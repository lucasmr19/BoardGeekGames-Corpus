# Features Submodule

The `features` submodule provides tools for **feature extraction** from board game reviews. It supports **lexicon-based sentiment features, linguistic analysis, and vectorization** for machine learning.

## Lexicons

### `lexicons.py`

- Handles **loading and managing lexical resources** for board game reviews defined as `.txt` files in the [lexicons](../../../data/lexicons) directory.
- Includes:

  - **Sentiment words**: positive, negative
  - **Modifiers**: intensifiers, mitigators, negations
  - **Domain-specific terms**
  - **Hedges**: hedge words, propositional, relational, discourse markers

- Provides combined sets for fast access (e.g., `all_hedges`).
- These lexicons are used in downstream feature extraction to compute **counts, densities, and proximity-based metrics**.

## Linguistic Feature Extraction

### `linguistic_extractor.py`

The `LinguisticFeaturesExtractor` extracts a **rich set of linguistic and textual features** from processed reviews (`CorpusDocument`) and returns a **single dictionary** suitable for `DictVectorizer`. Features include numeric metrics, ratios, counts, sequence-of-strings features, and co-occurrences.

**Note:** All features are combined into a single dictionary so that **numeric features are stored as floats/ints** and **sequence-of-strings features are stored as lists**, ready for vectorization using `DictVectorizer` or integration into ML pipelines.

## Vectorization

### `vectorization.py`

The `ReviewVectorizer` combines **textual features (TF-IDF)** with **opinion/linguistic features (DictVectorizer)** into a single sparse matrix, ready for ML models. It is **multilingual-aware** by prefixing tokens with the document language.

| `transform(tokens_per_doc, langs, opinion_features)`     | Transforms new data using already-fitted TF-IDF and DictVectorizer. Returns combined sparse matrix.                                                                                   |
| **Textual Features (TF-IDF)**                            | - Tokens with language prefixes<br>- N-grams controlled by `ngram_range`<br>- Maximum features controlled by `max_features`<br>- Stopwords removed if provided                        |
| **Opinion / Linguistic Features (DictVectorizer)**       | - Numeric and sequence-of-strings features from `LinguisticFeaturesExtractor`<br>- Handles counts, ratios, and co-occurrences<br>- Preserves all keys as columns in the sparse matrix |
| **Output**                                               | Sparse matrix (`hstack`) combining TF-IDF and opinion features for downstream ML pipelines.                                                                                           |
| **Multilingual Awareness**                               | Prefixes tokens with language codes (`en_game`, `fr_game`) to avoid conflicts in multilingual corpora.                                                                                |

**Example Usage:**

```python
vectorizer = ReviewVectorizer(max_features=5000, ngram_range=(1,2))
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(tokens_per_doc, langs, opinion_features)
X_new = vectorizer.transform(new_tokens, new_langs, new_opinion_features)
```

## Summary

- `lexicons.py`: Load sentiment, hedges, and domain-specific lexicons from `BoardGeekGames-Corpus/data/lexicons`.
- `linguistic_extractor.py`: Compute **numeric, syntactic, lexical, and hedging features**.
- `vectorization.py`: Combine **text and opinion features** into a vector representation for ML pipelines.

This submodule enables **feature-rich, multilingual, and lexicon-aware representations** of board game reviews, ready for classification or regression tasks.
