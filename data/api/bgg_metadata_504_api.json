    "description": "The Chinese Emperor has been powerless for a long time. Intrigue and corruption prevail within the city walls. Just before a wedding the ceremonial garments of the Emperor are stolen. How it happened is clear. A band of corrupt officials have exploited the waning power of the Emperor for themselves. The Emperor calls in his last faithful advisers (the players) and tells them &quot;Return the garments to me no matter what!&quot; The players heed the emperors request and try to find as many garment cards as possible.<br/><br/>",
