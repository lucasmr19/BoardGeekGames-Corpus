    "description": "A Heroic Fantasy Wargame wherein Peacemaker the Wizard, tired of eons of conflict over rulership of the island kingdom of Marnon, sets up a quest competition to choose the rightful ruler and end all bloodshed forever.<br/><br/>The map portrays the island of Marnon divided into 36 numbered territories and 8 bordering castle spaces. Orcs are placed in approximately 1/3rd of these spaces, then players place their Men in the remaining spaces. An opposing player places your 3 Magic Items around the map for you to find later. The first player to collect all three of their own treasures is the winner.<br/><br/>Each turn, Orcs around the board repopulate and then frenzy, indiscriminately attacking nearby Men. The Dragon flies around and eats Orcs and Men. Peacemaker the Wizard visits a region and bestows prosperity, and also enforces peace there that turn. After all this, each player may petition the Wizard for a card, receive reinforcements, and then carry out an attack campaign. Players forces include Men and two 'superpower' counters: Hero and Sorcerer.<br/><br/>Garret J. Donner later took his concept of objects moving semi-randomly and sometimes under partial control of the players (The Wizard and The Dragon) and designed the game Dragonhunt around it.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 2<br/><br/>",
