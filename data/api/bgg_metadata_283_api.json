    "description": "Advanced Third Reich is a board wargame published originally by The Avalon Hill Game Co. The game is a rewrite of Third Reich,  and is a simulation of the European and African theaters of World War II. In 2003 GMT Games published A World at War, a substantially revamped and streamlined version of Advanced Third Reich, designed by Bruce Harper.  Designed to reflect the corps scale, a turn represents three months of movement and fighting.<br/><br/>",
