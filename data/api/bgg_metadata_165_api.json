    "description": "Black Box  or &quot;KO-code&quot; is a puzzle game in which one player creates a puzzle by secretly choosing the positions of 4-5 marbles on a 8x8 grid.   The other player tries to guess their positions by shooting 'rays' into the grid and seeing how they bounce around.  The player requiring the fewest rays to solve a puzzle wins.<br/><br/>The German First Edition was named LOGO but the LEGO-Company was not amused with this Title and thought there will be a possibility of confusion. So PARKER renamed the Second Editon to ORDO.<br/><br/>",
