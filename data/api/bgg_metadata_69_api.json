    "description": "Bollox is easy to learn as there are only two rules. Playing the game of Bollox, well, is a bit trickier.<br/><br/>Your objective? Get five pieces in a row. Sounds easy, right?<br/><br/>Rule One: Black plays first. Still sounds easy? Not so fast!<br/><br/>Rule Two: The seemingly sudden 'Sandwich Move'. Just like it sounds, when you entrap two of your opponent's pieces between two of your own, you get to &quot;evict&quot; one of your opponent's pieces. This 'Sandwich Move' really does &quot;bollox up&quot; the game plan of the unwary player. Often the Sandwich Move can completely turn the game around and give you a dazzling win.<br/><br/>1999 Mensa Select<br/><br/>",
