    "description": "A game about the consolidating of power in the Holy Roman Empire in 1452. Players attempt to gain victory points through a variety of sources. In a system that has similarities to El Grande, players have a limited number of actions each turn to place resources into territories on a map. Going beyond El Grande, the game provides several different types of resources to manage and also gives players several different ways of undermining other players' positions.<br/><br/>One element that stands out is a balancing mechanism where the weakest player each turn is crowned king and is given several benefits. The weak player then has a strong military advantage in getting a better position in the game.<br/><br/>",
