    "description": "Players bid for the right to choose which of three locations the marker will go. Once there, any of the players can score by having a corresponding card for that location.

The goal of the game is to score enough points to overtake a non-player scoring token that advances throughout the game.<br/><br/>Awards<br/><br/>1997 Vuoden Perhepeli<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Holiday<br/><br/><br/>",
