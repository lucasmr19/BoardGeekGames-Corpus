    "description": "This game was quite the rage at Essen 1997. Enough so that Funagain decided to get into the publishing business by producing a new version (with the same title), and that Kosmos later published an altered version as Kahuna.<br/><br/>The game itself is rather simple. There's a large collection of islands that are going to be connected by bridges. Bridges are placed onto the board when the matching card is played. The kicker is that when a player gets a majority of the bridges on one island, his opponent's bridges from that island suddenly disappear. Once the deck has been exhausted three times, the dominant force on the islands wins.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/>    Kahuna<br/>    Kanaloa<br/><br/><br/>",
