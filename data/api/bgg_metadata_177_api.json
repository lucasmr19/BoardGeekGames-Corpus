    "description": "The use of the word &quot;Advanced&quot; to describe this expansion followed existing Avalon Hill tradition. &quot;Enhanced&quot; is likely more appropriate.  Playing with this expansion is no more difficult than playing the base Civilization game.  This expansion reworks a few of the original rules, includes a reworked version of Civilization: Expansion Trade Cards Set and adds more civilization advancements to the technology tree.<br/><br/>Included are more civilization advancements (both quantity and type), which give the players new options for advancement, as well as a slightly restructured commodity trading round, which has new resources and disasters to be traded. The most significant aspect of the game is a restructuring of the advancement/victory conditions, which remove the limits on advancement cards.  Some claim this makes the strategies more homogeneous while others claim the reverse is true.<br/><br/>",
