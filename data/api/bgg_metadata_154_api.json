    "description": "The Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads compete to build the most track in the creation of America's transcontinental railroad, 1864-1869.<br/><br/>This interesting card game for two players has all the elements that lovers of train games fawn after.  Players use cards to generate rail, trains, commodity production, demand for commodities, bank failures, labor strikes, derailments and all kinds of other period flavor.  This richly themed game takes several hours to complete.<br/><br/>",
