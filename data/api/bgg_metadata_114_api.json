    "description": "This game comes inside what looks like a video tape case, which is definitely odd for a board game.  Inside the package are cards for properties on Manhattan island, workers, building materials, and building contracts.  Each turn, players turn over a card and either purchase it outright or auction it to the group.  But when the contracts get bought, players will need to negotiate a deal, because it's very difficult to build a decent sized building on your own.  The deal making is vicious and cutthroat, ergo the name.<br/><br/>The 1995 edition features rules in English, Japanese, German, Spanish and French (see the Tidwell review).<br/><br/>",
