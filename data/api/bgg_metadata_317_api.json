    "description": "This game, a sequel to Mafioso, is also published as Capone.  The object is to make money with illegal businesses and then reinvest your ill-gotten gains into 'legit' businesses.   Each turn, players use the cards they're dealt sequentially to take control of businesses with their family members.  Furthermore, if you wrest control of a business from another family, the foreign family members that were there are sent to 'sleep with the fishes.'<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Mafioso<br/><br/><br/>",
