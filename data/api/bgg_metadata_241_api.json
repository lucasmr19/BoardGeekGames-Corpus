    "description": "Each player represents a European syndicate backing expeditions. You begin by attracting a famous explorer such as Columbus, Magellan, Ponce de Leon or Cortez. Then you must outfit an expedition and set off on a voyage of discovery...<br/><br/>At sea, you must brave scurvy, storms and superstitions. After making landfall, you may encounter friendly natives or find yourself embroiled in rivalries, civil wars and prophecies. These and other difficulties will challenge even the boldest of conquistadors on their path to glory.<br/><br/>",
