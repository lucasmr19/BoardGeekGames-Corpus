    "description": "The Age of Arguments is set at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries.  It is a simulation of the struggle between the major European states for power in Europe and the emerging empires.  The turn order auction is a nice tweak that really tests your bluffing abilities.  The components are very cheap but that doesn't detract from the fun to be had with this game.<br/><br/>Contents: <br/><br/>    1 folded A4 sheet of rules<br/>    1 thin card map<br/>    66 war cards<br/>    4 empire markers<br/>    15 warzone counters<br/>    16 plastic counters<br/>    three sheets of money to be cut. <br/><br/><br/>",
