    "description": "extrapolated from sessions report:<br/><br/>The game comes in the long, flat Monopoly-style box. The 3-fold map depicts a circular &quot;street&quot; with 6 colored houses numbered 1 to 6 distributed evenly around the street. These are the player houses, assigned at game start by a die-roll. In between the player houses are other spaces such as &quot;S&quot; (Slob), &quot;C&quot; (Clean), Mischief Night, Recycle, Lose A Turn, Pot Luck, Wild, Sue Neighbour! and Start. There are 6 coloured heads (to match the player's houses), money in 10/20/50/100 bill denominations, 10 Slumrunner cards and 50 Slob cards. Slob cards have values from 10 to 70 on them and say things like &quot;Overgrown grass and weeds&quot;, or &quot;Junk Vehicles In Yard&quot;. Starred (*) cards don't count against you when a round ends. The rules are brief and are printed on the game-box insert.<br/><br/>The idea of the game is to be a clean/good neighbor and hence become the wealthiest neighbor on the block.<br/><br/>",
