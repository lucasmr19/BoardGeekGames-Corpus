    "description": "Each player is one of six Giant Monsters, stomping across a map of the USA in search of cities to destroy. The monsters run the gamut from the classic (enormous lizards and gargantuan apes) to the slightly more unconventional (50-foot glow worms, anyone?), and each has its own set of attributes and powers.<br/><br/>Ingeniously, everyone also controls an arm of the military, which can be used to attack and weaken the other monsters on the board. It's a losing battle for the militia -- monsters can wipe out military bases and reduce the total number of forces available to each player -- but you can get a few good licks in early in the game.<br/><br/>The battle escalates until the 20th city is reduced to rubble. At that time, all the monsters duke it out in a free-for-all, mano-a-clawo Monster Challenge; and when the dust settles, the last monster standing is declared the winner.<br/><br/>This game was remade into Monsters Menace America.<br/><br/>",
