    "description": "Translated as Soldier of Fortune, this game features players trying to construct a castle.  Each turn, players secretly select two actions from a possible six.  If a player is the only one to pick a particular action, then the action gives more benefits.  Otherwise, players pick certain actions to earn money, build pieces of their castle, steal from other players, or receive special action cards.<br/><br/>",
