    "description": "from the rules summary from Game Cabinet:<br/><br/>This little village, the arena of our game, could be anywhere in the world. It could be in the jungles, in the savanna or in the mountains. Four families live here, and each attempts to garner the most prestige. The sign of power and status stands before each cottage: the totem pole - the taller the better.<br/><br/>The Totem animal is the proud Tschukka bird. Its meat has nourished innumerable generations in the village, and the shaman of the village use their bones to cast spells.<br/><br/>In this game about family generations you have one goal:<br/><br/>Your family should become the biggest and most reputable in the village and your totem pole must be the first to have all six parts.<br/><br/>",
