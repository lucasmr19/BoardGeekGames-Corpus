    "description": "From the review: The game is a two part auction and bluff card game. The components are simply two packs of cards, a gavel, and the rules. One pack of cards comprises twelve sets of four categories of antique properties. There are four antique clocks, four items of antique furniture, etc. Each set has a points value ranging fairly evenly from Furniture at 1000 to Miscellanea at 50. The points decide the winner but otherwise have no direct relationship to monetary value.<br/><br/>This game is very close to Kuhhandel.<br/><br/>",
