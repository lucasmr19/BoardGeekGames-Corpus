    "description": "The object of the game is to be the first player to build a complete leak-free pipeline, from your valve card to your spout card. The iron/lead pipe cards can 'leak' (via opponent sabotage), and be repaired with a wrench or a replacement pipe segment; the copper pipe cards never leak. The minimum number of pipe cards you need to place in between the valve and spout varies by the number of players.<br/><br/>In versions that support up to 4 players:<br/>2 players = 12 pipe cards<br/>3 players = 10 pipe cards<br/>4 players = 8 pipe cards<br/><br/>In versions that support up to 5 players:<br/>2 players = 15 pipe cards<br/>3 players = 12 pipe cards<br/>4 players = 10 pipe cards<br/>5 players = 8 pipe cards<br/><br/>",
