    "description": "The Elven king is dead, and players are competing to become the next king.  This game is similar in nature to Elfenroads/Elfenland in that players try to visit as many cities as possible using optimal transportation cards; what's different is that the lay of the land is also dictated by card play.  Other players may interfere with your journey through the use of thieves, obstacles, and sea serpents.<br/><br/>",
