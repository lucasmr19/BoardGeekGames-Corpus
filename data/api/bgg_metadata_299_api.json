    "description": "A flexible, fast-playing set of miniatures rules. An army consists of 12 units (called &quot;elements&quot;), classified as Blades, Warband, Knights and so forth. The rules are very simple (and can actually fit on one sheet of paper) but nevertheless pretty effective.<br/><br/>The Fantasy version is Hordes of the Things, and the De Bellis Multitudinis: Wargames Rules for Ancient and Medieval Battles â€“ 3000 BC to 1500 AD rules add more detail and significantly increase army size.<br/><br/>De Bellis Renationis extends the time period through the end of the Renaissance (1700 AD) and Horse, Foot and Guns covers the period from 1701 to 1915.<br/><br/>",
