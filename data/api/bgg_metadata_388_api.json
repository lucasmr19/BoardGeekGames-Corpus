    "description": "Another game in Kosmos two-player series, this game casts players as soccer (football) coaches on opposite teams.  Players use special square cards to represent the players they have in each of the positions: strikers, mid-fielders, defenders, and goalies.  Each turn, one of the two players will be the offense based on a simultaneous selection of cards from their respective play books.  Then players allocate their players to the current play, which rotates the used players.  A player card has a number of soccer balls on each edge, which tells how many skill points the player will contribute to a given play, and using the player (thusly rotating him) might actually weaken him for the next use.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/>    Tooor!<br/><br/><br/>",
