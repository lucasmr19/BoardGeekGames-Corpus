    "description": "Airlines vie for control of the American skies in this hybrid business/war game. Each turn, the active player decides whether make an investment or, to forgo income for a round and enter Fare Wars. In Fare Wars, players pay and roll dice to take over individual spokes to control major-city hubs. Income is generated by randomly drawing purchased spokes and controlled hubs. When a player, on their turn with no outstanding loans, has a mix of market share and cash on hand that equals or exceeds the winning target (which varies with number of players), that player wins.<br/><br/>",
