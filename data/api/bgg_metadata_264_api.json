    "description": "Enemy in Sight, originally called Cutthroats and Cannons, was two years in the making.<br/><br/>It is a fast paced card wargame with a good mix of strategy and luck of the draw.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a fleet of six ships and six cards. As your ships are destroyed your hand size diminishes as well.<br/><br/>One of the most unique characteristics of the game is the walking disasters. The red cards in EIS move around the table from player to player until resolved.<br/><br/>",
