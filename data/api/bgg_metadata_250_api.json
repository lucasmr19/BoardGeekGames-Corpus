    "description": "This is a different version of the original The Avalon Hill Game Co classic, Diplomacy.<br/><br/>Players represent one of the colonial countries (France, UK, Holland, etc.) sparring over the lands and riches of the Far East.  There are only two kinds of units: sea and land.  On a turn, each of your units has only a few options: hold in place, move into an adjoining territory or help another unit move into or defend an adjoining territory. Movement mechanics are incredibly simple and fused to a significant negotiation element.<br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Diplomacy<br/><br/><br/>",
