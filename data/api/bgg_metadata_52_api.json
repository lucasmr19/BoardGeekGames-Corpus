    "description": "Mighty Empires is both a strategic layer to the Warhammer Fantasy Battle (Third Edition) system and a boardgame in its own right.  It allows players of the miniature game to manage a kingdom, explore the world, and attempt to conquer other kingdoms, but it also can be played standalone as a fantasy wargame.  The game board is constructed with hexagonal tiles to create a unique land with mountains, hills, river valleys, lowlands, and coastal areas.  The game comes with some nifty bits representing armies, castles, cities and villages.<br/><br/>",
