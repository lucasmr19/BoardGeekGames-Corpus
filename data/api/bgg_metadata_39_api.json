    "description": "Based on the books of Marion Zimmer Bradley this game melds your typical strategy game with what would normally be found in a party game.  Players vie for control in a world steeped in psychic energy.  Mixing strategic placement of counters with chanting and &quot;I dare you..&quot; party game mechanics makes for a truly unique game.<br/><br/>",
