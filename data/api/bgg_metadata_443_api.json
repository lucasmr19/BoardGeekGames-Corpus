    "description": "The clever little game Code 777 combines the elements of a good, logical deduction game and Indian poker. Each player receives a rack for keeping three tiles drawn from a pool of tiles, which are seven different numbers in seven different colors (28 tiles in total); however, the rack is turned away from you. When players sit in a circle, each player can see everyone else's tiles, except their own. Each turn, players draw a card with a question like, &quot;Do you see more yellow sevens or more blue sevens?&quot; which should help the others determine their tiles. Once you're reasonably sure of which tiles you have in front of you, you can take a guess &mdash; but if you're wrong, you have to start over with a fresh set of tiles ...<br/><br/>Code 777 was explicitly inspired by What's That on My Head?, and Alex Randolph credited Robert Abbott with co-designing this game based on that inspiration.<br/><br/>In 2010, Stronghold Games released Code 777: 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, adding both a fifth player to the game and symbols to make it colorblind-friendly. In 2015, Stronghold Games released Code 777: 30th Anniversary Limited Edition, which is the final edition from Stronghold Games.<br/><br/>In 2015 DiceTree Games released a multi-lingual edition of the game.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    What's That on My Head?<br/>    Egghead<br/>    Figure It<br/>    Amnesia<br/>    Guess What I Am!<br/>    Coyote<br/>    Pow Wow<br/>    Am I a Banana?<br/>    What's That on My Head?<br/><br/><br/>",
