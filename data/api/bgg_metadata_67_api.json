    "description": "Conquest was designed to be a diceless wargame.  Its latest version updates the original with plastic units and a colorful map.  Set in ancient times, Conquest has players utilizing troops, cavalry, chariots, elephants and ships to try to capture their opponents' fortifications or occupy the &quot;quest&quot; locations.  The map is designed for point-to-point movement, and play hinges on a pool of action points that each side uses to move its different units.  Conquest comes in two versions, one designed for four players and one designed exclusively for two.<br/><br/>",
