    "description": "Trying to squeeze Diplomacy into a reasonable amount of time, Eon designed Borderlands to be a game where political wrangling is a must, and a free market society fuels the ambition for conquest.  Borderlands blends the conflict and deal-making elements from Diplomacy with resource management inspired by Settlers of Catan.<br/><br/>The German edition of the game, Ascalion, contains elements from the two Borderlands expansions.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by<br/><br/>    Gearworld: The Borderlands<br/><br/><br/>",
