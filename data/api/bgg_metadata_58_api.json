    "description": "Kings &amp; Things is a classic Tom Wham game of warring kingdoms in a fantasy world and the legions of things that inhabit them. The board is made from hex tiles, which allows for a different board layout every time. Utilizing an interesting flipped counter element, players attempt to out bluff one another regarding the types of things they have in their armies.<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    King of the Tabletop<br/><br/><br/>",
