The games in this set are based on the Napoleon At Waterloo system which is a basic movement-combat system with hard zones of control.<br/><br/>CRT has unique EE (Equal Elimination) feature.  A die roll of 6 will result in an attacker with unit strength of 12 and a defender with unit strength of 2 both being simultaneously eliminated.<br/><br/>This game was republished on Tactics #47 by Hobby Japan in 1987.<br/><br/>",
