    "description": "Simple Knizia game for children. Progress up the trail to the foot of Kilimanjaro by playing numbered cards. You can play cards in front of yourself to make 3 piles, or onto your opponents to slow them down if they're ahead of you on the trail. The cards are in different types (colors), canoe, mule, jeep or by foot. If your 3 cards are the same type, you can move the total. If 2 cards match, you can move that total. If the 3 cards don't match, you can move the highest number.<br/><br/>In addition, there are chance tokens laid on the trail face-down. These are revealed as you reach them; the banana is a meal-break (take another move), a lion is danger (fall back to the last village), or a swap tile lets you switch places on the trail with another player.<br/><br/>The player that reaches the mountain first wins, but if the players exhaust their decks, then the furthest along the trail is the winner.<br/><br/>",
