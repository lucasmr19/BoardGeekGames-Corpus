    "description": "The players put together four shows in any order.  To accomplish this, players draft actor cards from a constantly changing queue of cards.  Each card represents actors of varying skills at roles.  Once a player puts together all the needed roles for a show, the value is judged against all the other productions of that type, with points given relative to the other productions.<br/><br/>This is a Queen Games reprint of the db-Spiele original, Premiere.<br/><br/>",
