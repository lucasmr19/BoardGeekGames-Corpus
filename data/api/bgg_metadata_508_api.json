    "description": "In &quot;Blue Max&quot;, each player pilots a World War I airplane in a dogfight. This  wargame can be played as a campaign, with new planes becoming available as time passes, and with surviving pilots getting better at what they do.<br/><br/>Each plane has a maneuver sheet showing which ones it is allowed to do -- some maneuvers can only be executed by ace pilots, and other maneuvers are &quot;restricted&quot; in the sense that they can't be repeated from one turn to the next (the plane would stall).<br/><br/>If you &quot;tail&quot; another plane, its pilot must show you whether he's going right, left or straight ahead. You get to shoot ahead of your plane, unless you have a bomber with an observer/gunner in the back (swivel-mounted guns). Damage is rolled on a table that determines severity in terms of blue and red hits; you then draw the indicated number of coloued chits from a cup. Hits are taken to the wings, tail, engine, etc. There's a chance the pilot is killed, or that the plane catches fire.<br/><br/>Fuel eventually runs out and the pilots fly off to meet another day --if they survived. <br/>This is a lot of fun with massive numbers of players; you can put the 20-odd planes on the map at once, balancing the better airplanes with weaker pilots.<br/><br/>The second edition introduced crude altitude rules, and in 1995 GDW put out full-blown miniatures rules.<br/><br/>The 2014 edition of Blue Max had substantial changes, and can be found with its own game page HERE.<br/><br/>",
