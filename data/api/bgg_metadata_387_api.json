    "description": "Described by the designer as a cross between Doris &amp; Frank&#039;s Banana Republic and stud poker, this game casts players as construction company owners who are seeking to bribe various government officials for lucrative building contracts.  Each turn, six new contracts are up for grabs, and players compete for them by placing secret bribe amounts.
