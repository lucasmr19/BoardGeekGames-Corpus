    "description": "Bucket Brigade is a card game with a racing track by Reiner Knizia. Players use colored cards (numbered 1 or 2) to move four colored tokens along a track. The color that wins the race makes cards in that color worth +3 at the end of the round.  The other three, depending on how far they advanced, are worth anywhere from +2 to -1.  If a color moved farther, its color are worth more points -- but you probably spent more of that color to move it there, giving you fewer points!  Irony.<br/><br/>The new Bucket Brigade edition by Face 2 Face Games uses the exact same rules, score levels on the racetrack, and card distribution as the original, but instead of Honeybears, the racing tokens are firemen ascending a ladder.<br/><br/>",
