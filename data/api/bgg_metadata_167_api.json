    "description": "You may not expect much from a game about potato farming, but there's quite a lot to this one.  Each player owns a farm of five fields, and over the course of several years must deal with such issues as crop rotation, market watching, over-fertilization, insects, weather, and more.  As the game winds to a close, the winner will be the player with healthiest fields as well as the greatest profits.<br/><br/>Note: The first edition of the game is for 2-4 players (later editions are for 2-6).<br/><br/>4th Place 1989 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb.<br/><br/>",
