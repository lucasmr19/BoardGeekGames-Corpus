    "description": "The Battle of the Bulge is an historically correct re-creation of the famous World War II campaign of the same name.  The 101st Airborne Division is hopelessly encircled at Bastogne. The German commander demands surrender. General Anthony McAuliffe replies to the demand with one simple word &quot;Nuts!&quot;.<br/><br/>The game's scale is 3.2 km (2 miles) per hex; 12 hours per turn. Units are regiments and brigades. 377 Counters (including blanks)<br/><br/>",
