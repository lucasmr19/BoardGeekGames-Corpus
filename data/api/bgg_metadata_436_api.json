    "description": "Canyon is a trick-taking game in which players try to predict exactly how many tricks they will take.  The number of cards in a hand increases and then decreases in size.  A correct prediction gives your marker movement points around a scoring track depicted on a river in a canyon, whose main feature of interest is a section of &quot;rapids&quot; near the finish line where your marker will be &quot;caught in the current&quot; and sent back a few spaces if you go too many hands without a correct prediction.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Bid & Bluff<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Grand Canyon<br/><br/><br/>",
