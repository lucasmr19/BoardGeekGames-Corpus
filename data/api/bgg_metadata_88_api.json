    "description": "Torres is an abstract game of resource management and tactical pawn movement.  Players are attempting to build up castles and position their knights to score the most points each turn.  Players have a limited supply of knights and action cards that allow special actions to be taken.  Efficient use of pieces and cards, along with a thoughtful awareness of future possibilities, is the heart of this game.<br/><br/>Torres is considered by many to be an informal member of what is referred to as the Mask Trilogy.<br/><br/>",
