    "description": "One of game designer Sid Sackson&#039;s greatest contributions to the negotiation genre, this game has players  trying to construct the best buildings in a rapidly growing city.  The map is a collection of city blocks broken into smaller properties.  Each turn, players choose one property and try to work out deal for placing a new structure on the board.  The value of each building is determined by the type of buildings in the same block, so both a school and an apartment building receive bonuses for existing together.<br/><br/>",
