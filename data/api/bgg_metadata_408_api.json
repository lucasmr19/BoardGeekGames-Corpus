    "description": "This is a non-collectible card game; it comes in sets of two pre-built factions (e.g. Rhinogoths &amp; Monkus or Warus &amp; Boarix). The Zoon are warring tribes of genetic experiments that humans left behind on Earth. Half human, half animal, the Zoon fight while humans observe their behavior from space.<br/><br/>The El Moondo version came in sets of four factions decks, and contained rules for a four-player version, in addition to the standard two-player game.<br/><br/>",
