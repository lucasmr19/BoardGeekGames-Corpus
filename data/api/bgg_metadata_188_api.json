    "description": "In the game of Go, players alternately place stones on empty intersections of a 19x19 grid. The goal is to enclose territory behind stone perimeters and, secondarily, to tightly surround and capture enemy stones. The game ends when both players pass. The players then add up their territory and deduct the number of captives lost. Higher score wins.<br/><br/>As you see, the concept of Go is simple. The tactics and strategies, however, are deep enough to enrich a lifetime. Actually many lifetimes, for the game has been played for thousands of years. With so long a lineage and a worldwide following, Go has come to be known by different names (Weiqi, Igo, Baduk) and to be played by different rules. The rule differences are small, though, and seldom affect play.<br/><br/>So welcome to this masterpiece that is the game of Go, the race for geographical control of an unclaimed land. Experience running battles and swift reversals, bold invasions and painful sacrifices, each sally, each setback playing out to the tap of stone on wood.<br/><br/>",
