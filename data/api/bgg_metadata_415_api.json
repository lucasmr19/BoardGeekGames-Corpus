    "description": "Espresso is essentially a multiplayer version of a standard solitaire or patience game played in real time, something like the traditional card game Racing Demons, although it has significant differences from that game.<br/><br/>It is also more or less a clone of the well known game Ligretto.<br/><br/>Each player has an identical set of 36 cards (9 each in 4 colors) from which a stack of 9 is randomly dealt as the &quot;espresso&quot; stack - this must be gotten rid of by playing to common stacks in the center of the table. These stacks must each be built up from 0 to 8 in a single color. Players have 3 other face-up cards to help them, and can turn over cards from the rest of their deck to provide further alternatives.<br/><br/>",
