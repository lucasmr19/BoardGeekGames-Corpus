    "description": "Cat Blues, first released as Katzenjammer Blues, is an unusual hybrid of rummy and auction rules, with a couple of strange ideas thrown in about the game ending once 20 points total have been scored, with a 5-point penalty for most jokers. It's a quick, cutthroat card game, colorfully decorated with cartoony blues-band cats and mice.<br/><br/>",
