    "description": "This is definitely one of the more unusual offerings from our German friends. An assortment of oddly shaped wooden blocks are placed onto a round, wooden 'platter.' The platter has a cork ball on its underside, which is then placed on top of a conical stand. The trick is that the oddly shaped pieces are to be removed one-by-one, which has a high probability of upsetting the whole contraption's delicate balance. The bigger the piece that you remove when it's your turn, the more points you'll score, but you have a higher likelihood of spilling everything, which scores you negative points.<br/><br/>",
