    "description": "Starship Troopers: Prepare For Battle! should not be confused with the original Starship Troopers wargame, also by The Avalon Hill Game Co, published in 1976.<br/><br/>Starship Troopers was based on the Heinlein book.  Starship Troopers: Prepare For Battle! is based on the film version.<br/><br/>This is a fast-paced tactical wargame which begins simply and then adds additional rules with each new scenario.<br/>Note that the original Starship Troopers game has completely different rules, maps, units, etc.<br/><br/>",
