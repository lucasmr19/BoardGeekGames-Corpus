    "description": "In Sky Runner, players become daring cat burglars scaling a towering skyscraper in a race to reach the top. Using a simultaneous bidding system reminiscent of Raj/What the Heck?, players compete to win cards that enable movement, sabotage, or stealing vital gear from rivals.<br/><br/>But this isn&rsquo;t just a numbers game&mdash;Sky Runner adds clever twists to the bidding genre with unique &quot;parasite&quot; cards, sneaky sabotage moves, and equipment-swiping showdowns. Outmaneuvering your opponents is just as important as climbing quickly.<br/><br/>The modular 3D board allows for a variety of layouts and difficulty levels, ensuring each game feels fresh. As the skyscraper changes, so too must your tactics.<br/><br/>With its fast-paced gameplay, chaotic bluffing, and vertical ambition, Sky Runner delivers a clever mix of strategy, sabotage, and sky-high suspense.<br/><br/>",
