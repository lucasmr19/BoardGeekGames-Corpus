    "description": "Freibeuter is a game of playing your boats in spaces allowed  by the cards you've drawn in hopes of being part of a capturing team of surrounding boats.   Sometimes you play the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; which can go more places but disappears as soon as the capture is made.  You also have the option of positioning to be the main deal-maker on a capture, which leaves you paying off all the surrounding boats but getting more money yourself on the deal at the end of the game.  Timing, of course, turns out to be a nice matter for judgment.<br/><br/>",
