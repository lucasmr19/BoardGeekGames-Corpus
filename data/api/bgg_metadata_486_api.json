    "description": "In Barnyard Buddies, a bunch of cards depicting various animals in different colors are placed faceup on the table. Each turn, one player reveals a card that depicts four animals, each in a different color. All players race to figure out the animal and color not depicted on this revealed card, then grab the card on the table showing this colored animal combination.<br/><br/>This quick, mind-crushing exercise continues until the deck is depleted. Whoever collects the most cards wins!<br/><br/>",
