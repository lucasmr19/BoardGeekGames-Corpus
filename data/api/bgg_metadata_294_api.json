    "description": "Independently produced by British game designer Richard Breese, the three hundred copies of this game sold within hours of its initial offering at Essen 1998.  Players represent a family of medieval professionals, such as Stonemasons or Fishermen.  Using a set of numbered tokens and some misdirection, players try to achieve control in several areas of the board.  Perhaps they are seeking resources.  Or perhaps they will use their hard-fought resources to purchase special actions, magical spells, or a piece of the royal Keylore.  The first player to acquire all three pieces of regalia and take them to the throne room is crowned King and is the winner.  Re-tooled, this game was re-released as Aladdin's Dragons in 2000.<br/><br/>Keydom is Richard Breese's second game in the key series.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Aladdin's Dragons<br/><br/><br/>",
