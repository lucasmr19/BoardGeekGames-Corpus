    "description": "Part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.<br/><br/>Each player has 12 metal pawns (which feel great to hold and move!) and the object is to move these pawns into the back two rows on the opposite side of the board. The first player to accomplish this is victorious.<br/><br/>Movement is very basic. A pawn can only move by leaping over other pawns, ala Chinese Checkers. However, a pawn may leap over any number of pawns that are in a row, either vertically or horizontally. Players alternate making moves until someone wins.<br/><br/>",
