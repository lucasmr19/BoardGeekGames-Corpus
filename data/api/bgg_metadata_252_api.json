His aggression was stopped by the Russian Army and the winter effect.<br/><br/>Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #32 game published by SPI in 1972. 100 counters<br/><br/><br/><br/>(user comments:)<br/> This game is broadly considered to be one of the early classics of wargaming. Though a crude simulation by today's standards it has many of the hallmarks of what makes a &quot;game&quot; one that is good.
