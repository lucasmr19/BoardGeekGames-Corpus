    "description": "An auction game in which players bid from their pool of &quot;worker rats&quot; to gain control of corporate projects.  The workers from the winning bid are then are assigned to the project.  Each turn, one worker is removed from each project.  A project is complete once all workers have been removed.  The value of a numbered project is only determined at completion by a die roll. Two other projects, Veto and The Big Cheese, allow special actions during the game. The game has two different scoring schemes, depending on whether players use a single six-sided die or a set of seven polyhedral dice.<br/><br/>This is part of the Hip Pocket Games series.<br/><br/>Awards<br/><br/>1999 Listed in GAMES Magazine's GAMES 100<br/><br/>",
