    "description": "This frantic game is a wonderful exercise in word-summoning.  In it, players try to come up with a word that contains a certain sequence of letters before the ticking time-bomb in their hands explodes.  The bomb is an electronic timer with a variable time allotment, and a player is only allowed to pass the bomb to the next person when he comes up with a word that contains the needed letters.  While creative spelling of the words in question can be frowned upon, it's up to the guy next to you to determine your fate.<br/><br/>Awards<br/><br/>1996 Ã…rets Familiespil, Family Game of the Year Denmark<br/><br/>",
