    "description": "Mad professors test their experimental racing machines on the lab roof. Each player has a favorite machine, a set of movement cards for the racers and a secret score card. The score card shows the actual result you want to achieve, each player wanting the 4 cars to finish in a different order. The movement cards have 3 functions, showing number of spaces to move, or direction to move in, or 2 vehicles out of the 4 available that you could move. Start order changes each turn, the first player chooses one card of the three available, the next chooses a different type of card, the 3rd player the last type. The final player decides which car moves of the 2 cars that have been chosen as possible cars to move. The board also has random oil patches and hazards.<br/><br/>",
