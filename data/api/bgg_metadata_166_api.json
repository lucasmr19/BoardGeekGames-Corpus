    "description": "In this cheerfully demented offering, participants each play the part of a disease trying to inflict misery on the European populace.  Each disease has mortality (lethalness) and virulence (contagiousness) factors, and the key to causing maximum suffering is striking the right balance between the two.  It's no good being a fast-acting disease if your carriers all die before passing you on to the next city!<br/><br/>",
