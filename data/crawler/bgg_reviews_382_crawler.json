A totally banal game, at least among adults. Kramer himself in 1989 singled out Heimlich & Co as a game that wasn't really one of his favorites, despite its commercial success.",

Also, it is harder to control your destiny in this oneâ€¦ basic game appears to be somewhat unpredictable. Need to try again before rating.\n\nAn interesting historical note, from BGG's profile page on the designer Wolfgang Kramer...\nIt is said that Kramer's Heimlich & Co. was the first to use a victory point track going around the board (known among German gamers as a Kramerleiste). (See westpark-gamers.de interview.)\nLive link is on the designer page.",

Helps to prompt a great post game chat.\n\nDefinitely worth picking up as it's often pretty cheap and can be played with almost anyone.",
