Tones of heavily texted cards that break the basic rules in all possible directions but at the end of the day you get pretty average and extremely luck dependent card game. For the random factor of that big, the number of rules should be reduced to minimum to preserve rational proportion of rules vs luck. See e.g. „Star Wars the Deck Building Game” as a perfect reference of what I mean. Instead of fun I got a strong headache out of this jumble of asymmetric and often weird concepts on cards.",

    "comment": "I have good memories playing it as a child, but then I see who actually still plays it and it's a little gross. WAIT IT HAS CUTE ANIMALS NOW?! OK I'M TEMPTED.\n\nTo its credit, so many games are STILL trying to imitate what it did thematically, and for mathematical models, and deckbuilding, and drafting, and dueling.... wow. But I'm not much of a fan of this type of showdown, I'd rather have the politics and gameplay of Vampire The Eternal Struggle, but that's mostly dead. Netrunner's not bad, but feels weirdly scripted. ANYWAY.\n\nOne thing that stuck with me is when a youtuber learned the game, and said he liked it but the main flaw was the land system. To be honest I agree, and noticing how almost every clone (besides Pokemon) eliminated that entirely. Most of the expensive cards, FOR DECADES, were methods to bypass that land system and pretend it doesn't exist.\n\nI don't care about constructed tournaments, and even less for Commander (blech), but drafting still has some appeal. But with the costs involved, not interested.\n\nOn a side note, noticing how many boardgamers will turn up their nose at the financial model, but then buy every set of a LCG. Or buy tons of sleeves for tons of games. I'm not convinced that's the issue.",

Would be a 9.5 based on mechanics and did not have issues with collectability, printing, cost, greed and constant revision issues. Still willing to play with those 2-player battle decks, but not otherwise.\n\nFor the people who keep randomly asking in PMs, -NO- I will not sell you my remaining collection, the last few cards I have either have sentimental value or are worth far more than you're willing to pay.\n\nUpdate: I have been convinced to play the odd game of commander using someone else's deck and this format puts a great new spin on the game and I very much enjoy it. I am also glad to say that even being introduced to commander, I have no desire to start collecting again.\n\n2025 Update - Having considered getting back into this game because of how much I enjoy some \"kitchen table commander\" I looked into buying a deck or two for fun and found out about all the crap WotC has been pulling lately, so I adjusted my rating to the lowest possible. F%&* Wizards of the Coast, the only way I'll ever play this game again is by printing my own proxies.",

A boardgame should come with everything we need to put it on the table and play, and where the content is at our disposal to have access to the whole game. Or at least you can have the opportunity to collect everything from the game in an objective way.\n\nBut because of the way Magic has become, I don't consider it a game anymore. It is a lifestyle. And a very arbitrary one. I won't be able to compete with friends unless I invest in a specific way a lot of money. The base decks are so awful and boring that most people would simply put this game on sale if Magic were only these mediocre decks.\n\nBut more than that, Magic is a marketing business. I think it's a shame that so many teenagers are investing thousands of dollars, when they could have had a lot of better games for the same investment. And I think it's even more shameful that companies still promote this type of marketing. We should be passed that as consumers, but industries and influencers push us towards accepting it rather than criticizing it and getting over it.\n\nAll in all, it is not a game. It's a toxic investment. And it's an unequal one because it all depends on someone's income, available resources, and most of all, pure luck in a lottery system. I hope that as a gaming community, we'll stop falling for this and go to what a true game is supposed to be: fun with your friends and families, and a great and memorable experience with your closed ones.",

    "comment": "Hasbro-WotC did it again! I'm glad I sold most of my collection already and PROXIED most cards that cost $10~20 or above.\n\nREMEMBER: Commander Rules Committee explicitly confirmed that they had a long ongoing discussion with WotC for a long time about this ban, and therefore the ban was planned out by WotC from the beginning!\n\nThese are the banned cards:\n\n-Nadu (this card had to go; it was worse than what Sensei's Top did to Modern with Commander. Good job, CRC and WotC!)\n\n-Extortionist (color red is a far less attractive color now, and with this fact in mind, Extortionist needed to stay in Commander. However, since this card was in the watch list AND considered the strongest card by many, the ban seems be more or less justified. Yet the ban still leaves a lingering bittersweet taste in my mouth.)\n\n-Mana Crypt (didn't WotC just have a major set, selling a bunch of Mana Crypts less than a year ago?? What way to backstab your loyal customers! This ban was clearly a mistake, and no, this card wasn't in the watch list, along with Jeweled Lotus.)\n\n-Jeweled Lotus (similar to Crypt, Lotus had a major reprint not too long ago. But JL now can't be played in any format because it was exclusively designed for Commander. And remember, this card was THE chase card from a recent major set, just like Mana Crypt. Arguably this is THE most malicious ban from WotC to players in any format ever in Magic's entire history.)\n\n9/24/24\n\n\nHasbro-WotC finally did it. Yes, I'm talking about the 4 packs for $999 (plus tax) for 30th Anniversary Edition Set. This is very unacceptable, even if you are 100% at mercy of mercilessly tyrannical stock holders. Even if your business situation is more dire than described above, WotC should not expect any understanding from even the most die-hard supporters/fans, nor they deserve any in the slightest sense.\n\nWhat a great way to turn an occasion for celebration, an opportunity for a win-win situation into a thoughtless gamble, which led to a lose-lose disaster, by completely disregarding small magic stores and magic communities because nothing really mattered to WoTC, except for excessive short-term profit. A mere quick apology won't be enough to solve this major slowdown. WoTC better own their mistake by genuinely identifying and rectifying what went wrong, even at a heavy loss, because in the long-run they'll be better off by doing so.\n3—>1\n\nThe quality of cards has tanked down beyond below what ought to be even barely acceptable. On the other hand, the booster prices has gone waaay up.\n\nEtched foils? Seriously, as if the regular foil cards’ quality hasn’t gone down enough recently, WotC had to push even further by creating the dreadful etched foils; a lot of the etched cards (not all of them; a few of them actually looks very nice, but the majority of them look god-awful) are so misaligned in terms of focus/clarity of the picture, that even the letters of the cards look blurry. VERY DISAPPOINTED\n5—>3\n12/1/21\n\n\nMtg is an absolute failure in terms of balance: some cards are clearly better than others, creating unending power creep as time goes on, and this flaw also allows Hasbro to intentionally leech off their loyal customers by creating more OP and stronger cards indefinitely, forcing their loyal customers to keep spending a ton in order to stay competitive.\n\nRoughly speaking, 25% money (better cards/more options), 25% luck (lucky draws-topdecks), 25% deck building/netdecking skills, and finally 25% actual playing skills determines your overall strength in Magic (and of course, there is draft, which is just less card options and more luck involved). Magic clearly is a game that absolutely requires a player to constantly pay a high price tag if he wants to stay competitive.\n\nHardcore Magic fans love to point out how Magic is a game with endless possibilities, then I politely counter reply -while somewhat agreeing to their statement-, by pointing out how cards are overprinted (inflation; constant dependence of new influx of cards just in order to barely stay afloat; I mean, image if Hasbro stops printing new Standard sets: Magic would experience a slow death), and how the majority of Magic cards are not good enough to be usable (except in limited) in most constructed formats; a lot of what's considered as Magic's \"endless possibilities\" are far more artificially exaggerated (statistically) creating an illusion of much greater complexity than Magic is (I believe BGG's 3.3 Weight is about right; anyone who claims Magic has more strategy and depth than Chess or -god forbid- Go, is delusional; my point is, having a ton of useless and unviable cards does not make a game more complex, it's just more time-consuming in a very bad way) when you honestly think about it.\n\nHowever, if you can overlook Magic's (personally, unforgivable) flaws, then actually it's a very fun and addictive game.\n\nLastly, Magic is also a very fun social/multiplayer game. The possible amount of customization of your decks is pretty incredible, too.",

    "comment": "Well, my experience with MTG started when I was a kid in the mid 90s. Overall, it was an addicting game and my experiences were good for the most part. Fast forward to a couple of years ago where I decided to pick it up as a hobby again. Now that I'm smarter and less naive (and more aware of the great selection of independent games out there), I've found this game to be lacking.\n\nFirst: Even after years of development, this game is still poorly balanced. Set after set, my jaw drops in disbelief that they could not possibly realize how broken their cards continue to be. This problem is so severe that we see that all tournament winning decks (and by extension many more competing decks) all revolve around a small number of cards. If broken enough, rare cards are easily more expensive than their new category of legendary or super rares. This level of ineptitude for a company that has the financial resources and experience that it does should be unacceptable by today's standards where many smaller independent company's have developed beautifully balanced games involving asymmetrical warfare (sorry I couldn't come up with a better term off the top of my head).\n\nSecond: This point regards the costs. Now, I don't have a problem with games costing money and I understand that collectible cards games are a fun way to put a lot of money (in smaller more acceptable increments) into a hobby. My point here regards the competence of Wizards of the Coast yet again. Put simply, the \"pros\" and more in-touch MTG players don't even bother with booster packs. To illustrate, pros playing the game online would sooner sell the booster packs to save up more money for buying specific cards in the market place. So, this game has such severe balancing issues and such a rigid hierarchy in the value of cards that the purchasing of booster packs, which is supposed to be the most typical way casual and most players collect these cards, is cost inefficient and left for the \"suckers\". Further one this point of costs, Wizards of the Coast even go against their own incentives to inflate the costs of cards. They still don't ban cards that were clear mistakes in their major tournament (cough lotus needs to die cough). They used to reprint older sets in boosters. I've seen them and bought them. They were a little more expensive, but I was okay with it and understood why.\n\nThird: Finally, MTG is just an overrated game and is a drain on the gaming community as a whole. Like I've hinted at, I believe there is talent out there to design superior games than MTG. But there isn't a market for the collectable card game from a smaller company as it requires substantial distribution and widespread demand. Bot most kids who play MTG don't know about other options and once they burn out on MTG like some of the other 1 ratings you see here, they sure as heck don't want to move onto another collectible card. In conclusion, MTG needs to pass on to the next life. It's not that bad of a game, but the ineptitude of Wizards of the Coast and the fact that there's so much more potential out there is evidence enough that MTG detracts from rather than contributes to the gaming community.\n\nAs an afterword, this is all my opinion. Though, I do try to justify my opinion as much as possible. I hope this review contributes to a larger discussion (which should be had). Thanks for reading",

Despite everything it has going for it, on a scale for board games I rate it low if not very low. It doesn't feel like a board game because the buying, collecting and deck building is the foreground thing. The game itself is not that good most of the time! Usually more than 75% of the games are non-games because one player is either mana screwed or mana flooded.\nAlso, it is more of a family of games than a single game, because there are many deck formats and things you can do with the cards. You can even build own games/formats!\n\nThe balancing of the cards has become atrocious in the last few years! The overpowered cards ruin everything!\n\n+ fantasy theme and card tropes\n+ great fantasy artworks (!)\n+ some game mechanics\n- games are often decided by mana shortage or mana flooding or just bad draws even without opponent(s) interfering\n--- balancing issues, very bad playtesting (past few years at least)\n--- pay to win\n-- can be extremely expensive\n-- addictive in an unhealthy way\n- can be very time, money and space-consuming\n- makes people greedy\n-- too often bad print quality (especially bad for a premium priced collector's product!!)\n-- aggressive marketing (exclusive buy-a-box promos, product releases at extreme pace, adding Chinese characters just for the Chinese market even when they don't fit in, power creep and extremely pushed cards, ...)\n\n\nIt is astonishing how much MTG is _both_ luck-dependent and skill-intensive at the same time. In competitive play it is not only luck-dependent what cards you draw, but also the dice roll at start of the match and against who (deck type, player) you're paired. But you always need to have a deep knowledge of all the cards, the mechanics, the rules, the meta game, your deck and more. And practice is also important. Despite the high luck-dependence skilled players have a significantly higher win percentage, even though they might loose against a newbie every now and then.\n\n\nThe community is very hype-driven, which I very much dislike. And the card hoarding and financial speculators are close to ruining the game. Also, WotC is flooding out new product in a pace where it is impossible to keep up. And foreign IP crossovers ruin the core of the game.\n\nAlthough the overall print quality is relatively good, there are often cards that are off-center cut, which can be very annoying considering the high prices one pays for the cards.\nAnd also, sleeving the cards, which is really necessary, quickly becomes very expensive and very tedious.",

It's not that the design of the game is bad, and it can definitely have those really fun epic moments, but I'm not really interested in a pay-to-win style game where the development of cards and their interactions with the 20K unique cards that came before it is essentially left up to the player base to playtest and find \"oh hey this is broken af\" meanwhile it's allowed in play as MTG hasn't gone back to ban the broken cards they put out.\n\nThe real problem though is the pay-to-win side of this. For example, my buddy's EDH deck (Commander) has 6-8 land cards worth somewhere in the range of $2500. Now add in all the other cards he blew mad money on and he's at a $6-7k ~ deck now. He crushes anyone he plays with the deck, both in our game group and in the MTG tournaments held at game stores. He easily wins %95 of his games simply because he's spent more money on a deck than his opponents did. To really hammer this point home, I went and looked up a really expensive strong deck, took hours printing them out as proxies and putting them in sleeves, brought the deck to game night, and absolutely smashed people (Luckily my aforementioned friend wasn't there as his deck was still more expensive). It wasn't fun for any of us and it goes to show that this is a style game where you're rewarded for spending more money than your opponent.\n\nImagine if when playing Terraforming Mars you got access to better corporations and prelude cards to start and better main deck cards throughout the game because you had more money \"irl\" than the people you're playing against, providing you with a huge innate advantage. Who would play that?\n\n\"bUt HaViNg AlL tHeSe CaRd'S oPeN's Up PeOpLe'S aBiLiTy tO bE cReAtIvE\"\n\nSo then why is the situation worse in any standard format where this is only 2-3 decks that are in rotation as they are hands down the best and if you're not using them you're essentially playing to lose. I mean seriously go watch regular players to pro players play and they all use the same exact cards with tiny variations. But they have all these cards to choose from?!\n\nIt's either pay a crap ton of money to win in large open formats like Commander or Legacy or spend a crap ton of money to buy the new meta cards that literally everyone else is using.\n\nMTG is akin to EA with Star wars battlefront 2 or essentially any mobile game with microtransactions for that matter. \"Spend money to be a better player!\"",

I consider this an incredible rating, especially considering how badly the resource / mana / land system has dated and how frequently and strongly mana screwage or flooding can derail a game. Doubly so if the meta leads to a lot of games being decided via topdecking.\nAs the system in which this game exists: 2 \"Very poor. Annoying, I plan to never play this again.\" It's an exploitative business model and to play it optimally (at its most enjoyable level for me) you and the people you play with have to be multiple hundreds of dollars invested in new stock every year. It's hard to keep up and hard to play this with good friends (because you have to try and lure them into the system AmWay style). So once this game loses momentum with your preferred group of players you must resort to playing with randoms on the scene.\n\nMy last two experiences of this game were 1) going to a tournament where I only enjoyed 1 out of the 4 matches I played, and it was the match I lost. The other matches I played were terrible as the other players were miserable company on account of a varying range of afflictions from hyper competitiveness to lack of social graces. 2) Multiple rapid fire changes to the business model / structure clearly designed to milk more money out of players. Specifically adding dual colour painlands into the core set requiring hundreds of dollars on land investment alone for every competitive deck. The business jerkery has continued to escalate in my absence with a new tier of ultra rare Mythics, faster set rotation, a game pushing into a 3+ colour deck meta furthering the necessity and outlay on two colour rare lands, and probably a bunch more I haven't kept abreast of.\n\nSo while the game is brilliant, the system is the limiting factor that holds this entire thing back for me. My system rating completely overrides my game rating. They don't average out. My overall rating therefore is a 2 \"Very poor. Annoying, I plan to never play this again.\"",

    "comment": "Read most of the comments of people who rated this a 1. Most of them share my reasoning for giving this a low rating. This is a shameless money grab of a game which rewards having money over having skill. Will never play again with a serious player unless they have a spare deck as I will not spend hundreds of dollars on this game. There is a good chance I won't play again at all though, as I think there are better games to play and things to do. I haven't played in years as is.\nPast experiences have certainly soured me on this game as well, as many of the players devote large sums of money from each paycheck so to get expensive cards and be able to defeat and feel superior to their friends and other people. Many even resort to cheating. I have probably had some particularly bad luck with the regulars of this game, but many ccg's will attract this type of person.\nTaking away the atrocious behavior of Magic players I've dealt with in the past, and taking away the unfair 'he with the most money wins' element, and ignoring the fact that people have spent ridiculous amounts of money on this game in an attempt to keep up with others or chase rare cards or make others feel inferior, I will say a few other things about the game. The art on the front of the cards is decent, the card quality is pathetically bad (but if it were good they wouldn't have as much reason to charge you extra for those protectors, right?), the game has helped keep hobby shops alive because of how much people spend on it, it has helped bring people together because of its popularity (although I've also heard of many fights and lost friendships over the game as well), the mechanics of the game itself were relatively simple from what I can remember, and I myself was never blown away by it.\nHonestly, ignoring everything but the gameplay, I would still say that there are many better games out there to devote your time and money to.",

Which would be a rating of 1. Too bad that many gamers still fall for this kind of scam! Probably because if it weren't a contemptible CCG, the Magic card game would actually be a rather good game. But the pay-to-win CCG business model is simply an unforgivably huge drawback.\nPlaying \"Limited\" formats (Booster Draft or Sealed Deck) isn't a suitable solution for me as I definitely don't want to buy new boosters for each time I play. Playing \"Limited\" with already opened boosters might be a somewhat acceptable solution.\n\nHowever, I find it fascinating how Magic manages to offer widespread tournaments. I wish other popular games would learn a lesson from this and offer (more) organized tournaments. I realize they can't offer prizes as large because they don't exploit so many gamers to finance that, but they could still implement a more organized tournament scene. Some promo items as prizes don't cost much but can still be a sizeable incentive to compete for. I think FFG Organized Play is a very promising development in this area. Games Workshop's organized play for Warhammer Underworlds also looks promising.",

Many of them were playing the old \"rogue rules\" of when you lost a card, you LOST the card. I avoided places like that, but as money started to become tight, had to stop. I eventually sold off my collection, so don't ask me what cards I had.\n\nI never got started again because I felt it would draw me back in and I would be spending too much money.\n\nToday, seeing people in game shops get so fraking anal about rules and the condition of cards just makes me weep.\n\nIf you enjoy it, fine.

I know it's importance not just historically but financially as all game stores I know make the majority of their money from Magic tournaments and players buying cards. However every time I get back into this game the players get more and more toxic and far more sleazy. I remember a guy in college who ran a Magic racket with the new expansion. It was kinda sickening. Also like the Simpsons, it's a shell of its former self. EDIT: After looking at the more recent cards, the playtesters are getting lazy or just cynical since they are not picking up obvious combinations on things that aren't legendary seriously this game is the needed evil of ccgs. Despite making casual playing more accessible I still get a feeling that you can't just have one deck.",

Not my kind of art (I prefer stylized over \"realistic\" and not a fantasy fan), but worth saying.\n\nI also hate it. The land system is awful. The game feels overly limiting, with hand/mana constraints often makes moves obvious. It's slow paced, with the first couple of turns basically existing so Rush decks can be a valid strategy, with any other deck playing land and passing. Aggro/Combo decks are brainless, and Control makes a slow game last even longer.\n\nThen you have the whole rotation thing in a collectible game, I can't help but feel Commander/Draft/Cube/Pauper is the way the game's designed to play - probably a lot more fun too, since the deckbuilding is easily the best part of Magic, with the actual game coming second.",

    "comment": "There was a time when I was sensitive to the lure of Magic, but the lack of people to play against soon led to a faded interest. Many years later, I took an opportunity at a fair to play with a specially designed starter kit, and liked the simple mechanics. However, upon arriving home and opening up the pack of 60 or so cards, I got extremely frustrated about the lack of clear summarised rules, and the finickiness of the complete ones. I threw away the sets (to the chagrin of my girlfriend, she liked the artwork) and focused on other things. A game which doesn't come with good, clear rules, and requires a number of expansion kits for things to become interesting is broken by definition.\n\nYes, I know that nowadays you can get cheap decks which are not current anymore. Yes, I know it is your choice to allow yourself to become trapped in the money pit. Yes, I know you can agree with others to only play with a particular set, so the emphasis shifts from Ccg to cCG. Yes, I know the sight of countless slender adolescent boys with the occasional tomboy girl (model 'Homo sapiens geekis') thumbing through the dime-a-dozen binders hunting for a misplaced rare one, are not representative of the actual game. But since I don't know the 'actual' game as there are no clear rules provided with a deck, the game remains put at a rating of 2.\n\nUpdate The above all said, even if I was able to shell out some cash to purchase a complete set of cards of older editions so I could experience the activity of deck building, I highly doubt I would find Magic an appealing game. Recently I have played a number of Magic-equivalents: games where am I asked to create combos from a few to many separate cards drawn from either common or personal decks or anything in between. I've come to dislike such designs with passion as they violate a gaming principle I hold dear: that richness in gameplay should arise from simple rules. Magic breaks that principle with flair by allowing the cards to be played to more or less be rules in themselves. In a way you could say that I would probably find Magic too complex for the resulting game patterns which arise from such a design, and thus I still feel comfortable with the ranking I gave.",

Having said that, I was in college when this came out, in San Francisco, surrounded by fanatical MTG gamers who would twitch and speak in tongues at the mere hint that they might be able to obtain a missing Lotus or Mox card, many of whom were close friends of mine that I wanted to spend time with. I tried to enjoy playing. I couldn't. I can't. The very thought of playing MTG makes my brain feel like it's packed in gauze, and that's before I even contemplate the grotesque \"limited edition\" moneygrubbing that Wizards of the Coast engaged in by virtue of their control over both production and the rules. Roger Ebert's review of \"North\" is right on the money here: \"I hated this [game]. Hated hated hated hated hated this [game]. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it.\" [I'm giving this a \"2\" instead of a \"1\" because it is not \"clearly broken,\" although it is undeniably true that \"You won't catch me dead playing this.]",

    "comment": "It's a game that holds accountable for one of the most best selling Trading Card Games ever, but the way the gameplay evolved and the very expensiveness of this whole Magic card business made me question if my money would be worth for this.\nThe answer is that Wizards moves so fast that, every year, they commit to a lot of expansion work within months, releasing them at a fast rate while they keep refactoring format rules. I'd have to be honest, this game isn't for me if it comes to seriously investing it.\n\nThe art is great, yes (not everything really), and recently there's been tons of collabs, including the Final Fantasy one, but my ignorance for Trading Card Games doesn't permit me to appreciate at its core and i'd rather not fall in jealousy over the fact they're making so much money for it. Magic is a business. They're not making this game for pure love and you know how i recently pointed out Wizards for having some questionable decisions when they decided to make some odd changes to their new Dungeons & Dragons ruleset.\n\nAnyway, i didn't play the game physically, but i did play the game digitally on Magic: Arena, and you know how my refusal to give money to Wizards led me to get stuck into playing with fairly low decks. I hate these kind of games.\n\nI prefer playing card games that don't rely completely on gambling relative mechanics such as collectible packets, such as Fantasy Flight Games' card games, that still are expensive enough but NOT as THAT expensive as Magic, where you have to spend thousand euros in fewer days than spending thousand of Arkham Horror Card Game expansions over the course of your own life (and to be honest, there is no real pressure on it).",

Very hard to get an even match that is fun for both players as it relies on both players being equally skilled in playing the game, building decks, and investing a similar amount of money. The game is a huge money pit. Even if you do have two evenly matched players in the three categories because of the way resources are tied to cards you end up with a lot of nongames where atleast one player doesn't draw their resource cards or only draws their resource cards and can't play at all. This can happen at the beginning of the game and ruin it right away or in the middle/end of the game and cause it to end because someone just drew more effective cards for a few rounds and the other player didn't draw any response. Beyond that certain matchups are heavily biased in an archetypes favor so much so that even if all the above things don't ruin a game the game is likely decided before anyone draws any cards. Aggressive decks generally beat slow decks, mid range decks beat fast decks, and slow decks beat mid range decks.\n\nI primarily got into boardgames to get out of mtg and Warhammer which are great products that have some amazing strengths but are very expensive to keep up with, poorly balanced, and a lot of rules overhead.",

I vastly prefer playing EDH over traditional Magic, but it's not something I would want to invest a significant amount of time or money into, and unfortunately, that's sort of required if you want to be competitive. If you have a stable group of casual players, that experience can be quite different though.",

    "comment": "I have played this for a long time and I still go back to it sometimes (for the nostalgic magic feeling). However, competitively speaking, it is far from ideal. The reason is two-fold:\n1. Once the deck is built the strategic options are very limited and sometimes one can pass matches without any non obvious iteration (95% of the time the player will be played by the deck instead of playing it).\n2. Competitive deck-building is extremely dependent on the metagame. Decks that are not on the metagame rarely stand a chance (regarding reasonable win-rate), confining the strategic deck-building element to tweaks on a few already established decks (most champions' decks are tweaked versions of established decks on the metagame, some even with as little as 1% modification).\n\nConsequently, it is impossible to recommend it as a competitive game. Take chess, shogi or go as an example, when a game allows for skill to develop, a few players will win many championships and have win-rates close to 90%. In magic, anything above 60 or 70% is considered extremely high.\n\nMy rate is related to the above and the lack of interest and courage by the developers for improving the game towards a more competitive one, albeit the support of players like me for many many years.",

    "comment": "MTG is tough to rate, but this is for magic as it currently exists: primarily current sets and the state of things today. There are so many ways to play; this is a huge strength of the game. Playing a cube, drafting at a shop, online on MTGArena, this still is the best TCG ever made, and you could spend a lifetime exploring it. So much creativity in deck construction and deep strategic gameplay makes it a killer game for any friend group that can decide on a shared format.\n\nMagic is a game that relies heavily on momentum. From a design perspective, it has one serious issue: lands. I truly believe this is a terrible mechanic. When 20% of games are unwinnable for one of the sides, this is a bad design. Fans of the game will die on the hill that lands are great, but I think this is due to blinders and the fact that the rest of the game is so good. There are solutions that have been experimented with: MDFC's, lands with weaker versions of spells attached, should be the default. Period. Unfortunately the creators seem married to this idea of maximum variance, and players getting screwed regularly. How this is ok, especially in a game with a pro scene, is wild when easy solutions exist.\n\nI don't believe buying cards is worth it anymore. It's lost it's magic since Hasbro took over. The cash grab juicing of any IP they can get their hands on, the poorly tested and disconnected sets it's produced, and the stale, netdecking, unbalanced meta of the competitive scene. This game is in a pretty bad place currently. Combined with a general direction in design that is much less appealing for me (creatures with overpowered essays on them rather than stack play), this has all made me take a step back from my beloved MTG.\n\nThe creators are also beholden to the \"reserved list\". The promise to owners of absurdly valuable cards that they will never be reprinted. This is hilarious, ludicrous, and terrible for the game. Many people treat MTG cardboard as an investment portfolio, and WoTC caters to this, to the detriment of the game as a whole.\n\nThere's still fun to be had with MTG. No one is saying players need to buy new product, and the game was fantastic in years past, even with it's clearly poor design elements. I think I'd still like to build a few cubes, as this is where the game really shines, where a particular collection of cards is curated and drafted with a group.\n\nOverall though, this game has fallen from grace, hard. I have no interest in playing the current iteration, and it's genuinely a sad state of affairs for what was such a juggernaut in the gaming world.",

    "comment": "MtG played an big role in my gaming history. I started with 4th Ed. and I played it countless times. A couple of years ago I finally parted from MtG. Firstly, I have spent considerably more time building decks than actually playing the game, which I found increasingly unsatisfying. Secondly, I gradually distanced myself from the underlying marketing and business concept. People underestimate addiction and things can get out of control fast.\n\nMtG tends to put a too strong emphasis on competition, at least for some persons. I had great difficulty in finding a level of competitiveness that worked for me (not too much and too little), which is attributable to the fact that I invested much time in fine-tuning decks to adapt to a specific meta and it also shows in the many discussions we had in a closed group about that topic. Looking back from today, it feels like wasted energy.\n\nMy general rules of thumb for the future:\n- Keep it casual. Avoid the testosterone-fueled tournaments and drafting events\n- Loan a deck for an evening, don't pay for it\n\nUpdates: Participated in different events over the last few years like drafting, casual plays, online etc. I can't keep up with the lifestyle gamers anymore and even casual play isn't exactly fun anymore. One can play casually, but still has to read what the cards are doing during play. I no longer find meaning in the continuous commitment to understand the endless stream of new combinations and intricacies. Also, the meta seems to become more and more complicated.\n\nThere are too many adjustments and conditions to make it work for me these days.\n\nPlayed once again with a frend, Old School without power cards. It was nice.\n\n--------\n\nEdit: I started Old School 93/94, maybe X-Points, maybe Swedish, maybe Atlantic rules. It doesn't matter, because it's all super casual, playing only for fun, mosty with friends and persons who remember the beginnings. I even constructed a deck again and now celebrate the nostalgia, enjoy the artwork and the lore, and experience the game as it originally was.\n\n-----\n\nI'm playing MtG again from time to time.

    "comment": "Multi-player, and especially, Commander as Multi-player; to a lesser degree, EDH as such\n\nMagic is one of my favourite games of all time, but I feel compelled to rate EDH and multi-player in general separately from the main game. The reason is that at a fundamental level, adding more players (more specifically; more sides) to Magic makes the game play out very differently than the 1 on 1, or even one side vs. one side (i.e.: Two Headed Giant) and turns the game into something that I generally dislike in practice as the decision tree collapses down into politics the vast majority of the time, invalidating most of the other game considerations.\n\nTo understand why, you have to look at how Magic is constructed as a game. You have the fundamental skills of building a deck (sometimes with consideration for what the other players at your table / in your area are doing) as well as skillful play within the game itself.\n\nAt the multiplayer table, the game no longer directly rewards either of those skills and collapses into politics all too often as the person perceived as either being the most skilled, or who is thought to be piloting the most dangerous deck, or the person who currently seems most likely to win all become targeted and beaten back down into parity with the rest of the pack; until the next threat arises, and so on we go. What results is often a very long game where the winner is determined only in the last frame or two by a random draw or two that put them in position to win unexpectedly, or by a gaffe as someone finally fails to check the person to their left effectively.\n\nSome of this is just because of table conventions (people often hate to beat on the player in last, but because of that they linger and the game just goes on and on and on) but also is just endemic to the way MtG seems to play out in this format. I've played it multi in numerous groups over the decades, and the dynamic always seems identical.\n\nAlso, a not insignificant issue for me is that in multi-player there's often just too much going on at the table to really keep effective track of everything that is happening. I don't like slowing the game down to read everything that is coming out, but sometimes if you don't do a bit of that people just win with a combo, so the game effectively forces everyone to spend a bunch of time trying to keep multiple other board states in mind, with EDH being particularly bad about this because everyone is playing a large deck of singletons and modern card complexity creep means that almost every card now has a paragraph of text to parse.\n\nSome of the people I play with like the casual, politicky aspect of the game, but I've played enough of it over the years to know that this just isn't my jam, and I really try to avoid it as much as possible. The play in practice can hold my attention for maybe 30 minutes, but in practice any table with more than 3 usually makes for a game that is 60 minutes if it goes VERY fast, and usually is 2 to 3x as long as that depending on the decks, which is just way too long for what is actually happening in practice. The higher starting life total in EDH exacerbates the game length amongst \"fair\" decks, and also incentivizes combination wins to an irksome degree. In practice this means you have to spend yet more time insuring a combo isn't building, which means you need to pay even more attention to the other boards, which adds yet more time to the game...and on and on.\n\nWhen we do play multi, I always lobby for Planechase with a shared, totally random Planar deck as a way to at least shake things up in an interesting way as it can unexpectedly cause the game to change in a way that helps keep it somewhat more interesting for me and the 4 rating I'm giving here is assuming that that is in play. Without it, we're probably at least at 3, and in some ways, a real 2, as I think the game (as an an actual game as opposed to an activity) is just poor with more than two sides.\n\nOn a slight aside, EDH as such is also not a great format for my tastes. The higher life totals makes deck construction very combo focused to be competitive and the nature of this format seems to collapse the truly reasonable deck construction options down a lot because of that super high starting life total. Normal constructed has some semblance of balance between rush, mid-range, and combination / big haymaker end game play, but in EDH rush just isn't that great because the life totals are so high, so the only real \"rush\" option is to try and make a quick combo. The remaining 2 deck types tend to favour the bigger end game, which is why this format has long been known for \"Battle Cruiser\" type decks, which is some of the most boring Magic play for my play preferences.",

    "comment": "4/5\n\nMTG was the first trading card game. They needed to make money to produce Robo Rally so they made MTG to acquire the funds. MTG has tons of innovation, theme, and amazing artwork. It is hard to rival this game because it has been out since 1993. It is a wonderful competitive card game. Casual MTG is still the #1 way to play. Commander & Draft are okay. 10,000+ plays.\n\nThis is an older card game and due to that it has several outdated features. Other games have improved on MTG, but lack innovation or the card pool. This is also a TCG so the pay to win feature exists & the print crappy cards to make people spend more money exists. Simple way around that is to PnP your own stuff at a much cheaper cost and still have fun with the experience. There are better card games. There is no card game with a better card pool.\n\nHouse rule: update the land system to Duel Masters, Marvel Champions, etc... rules for a more streamlined strategic experience = less luck.",

    "comment": "While I respect the basic mechanics and think it's a well-designed card game, I can never get over card trading and lottery ticket booster pack style card distribution.\n\nI think if you could buy any card for just $0.10 or something, I'd be more inclined to play it, but I also think it would be a death knell for the game. I think, unwittingly or not, many players secretly love the rush of opening new cards from packs, and on top of that people who build decks sunk cost fallacy themselves into thinking they like the game more than they do.\n\nTrying to be creative with decks is extremely time consuming, and most people will just run bog standard net decks anyway, making standard a boring experience. Drafting is an okay experience for me, because at least the randomness is fair and the aspect of making decks is enveloped into the game itself, making it far more interesting. To build decks in limited requires knowledge of decades of releases.\n\nUltimately, in order to play any format more than casually immediately turns the hobby into an expensive, time consuming nightmare where you have to be constantly consuming content to stay up to date.\n\nNot to offend any fans of it, but I think most fans are playing more because they've already sunk so much time and money into it, they feel they *have* to get something out on the other end, even if the end result is actually fairly 'whatever'.\n\nFor the cost of one expensive EDH deck, I can buy ten classic board games that will give me infinitely more joy and replayability. Board games are also not subject to pay to win, net decking, or excessive time and money consumption. For me it's a no brainer.",

J’aime pu le hazard de la pige, j’aime pu le take that combo de muerté qui tue en 3-4 tours, j’aime pu me faire chier à tapponer sur mes deck, j’aime pu mettre de l’argent dessus, j’aime pu mettre du temps dessus et j’aime pu y jouer. That’s it, I’m done. J’arrive pu a avoir du fun, donc il est temps d’arrêter.\n\nJe répette sans cesse à qui veut bien l'entendre que j’avais été échaudé, que j’avais eu des expérience chiantes, que j’avais eu des mauvais moments de jeu et que j’avais joué avec les mauvais joueurs. Mais je dois en venir à l’évidence, c’était moi le mauvais joueur. J’espérais de Magic une expérience de jeu qui n’exite plus. Qui est une expérience de duel balancé, exitante et qui dure assez longtemps pour goûter à ses stratégies. C’est fini le temps ou tu pouvais gagner avec une Serra Angel. Fini le temps des duel en 10 tours car on avait des monstres aussi fort. Magic c’est du Pay to Win, pis j’ai pu envie de payer. Magic c’est se tenir à jour avec les nouveaux sets qui rendent les précédents désuets. Ben j’ai pu envie de mettre d’énergie et honnêtement, ce modèle m’a jamais plus. Je dois donc en venir à l’évidence, je ne suis pas le publique cible. Dans ma tête Magic c’est de la MARDE, donc autant me retirer.\n\nJ’ai pensé garder mes deck de Commanders car ce format se rapproche beaucoup plus de l’idéal que je cherche, mais ça reste Magic. Pis Magic ben j’en ai ma claque. Donc vous l’avez deviné, je vais vendre mes cartes et me débarrasser de tout ce que j’ai de Magic. J’ai beau essayé de me convaincre que je pourrais vouloir y rejouer, mais quand je regarde ma collection de jeu de société, je me dit que je m’ennuierai pas. Les jeux modernes ont tuer Magic pour moi, je n’y vois que ses défauts et je veux pu payer pour parer au problème. Le modèle CCG est pour moi une fausse à argent sans fin que je n’accepte plus d’encourager. Donc, pour la deuxième fois, Magic is DONE!!!

The land system and lack of robust card draw are simply showing their age in real bad way.\n\nedit: Realized after LOTS of time with the game that it is not the game I want or need it to be. The average constructed deck, let alone kitchen deck, is much too finnicky to be relied on as far as having an enjoyable game goes. Combat damage not sticking around between turns means that board states can get either very \"gummed up\" or one-sided quite easily.

    "comment": "Ownedr by Matt and Kailin and Titus and David and James.\n\n==2022/07/20==\nOh! That's the word I was searching for.\n\nMagic has no surprise. There's no delight from the unexpected. My deck really only does what I design it to, and building a deck involves thinking really hard about what it does.\n\nGames which hand you pre-made decks and don't need construction have more delight, because all the learning about the decks happens during the game instead of outside of it. Spending time learning about my Magic decks outside the game ruins the playing for me.\n\n==2022/07/15==\nI have a Commander deck that I've customized, and playing the deck isn't interesting? I'm just using synergies that I've already spent time thinking about, and the \"fun\" of building a Magic deck is finding the synergies outside the game when building. Playing a deck is just vindicating that those synergies in the deck actually work. Like, I already know that Antiquities War will get me a player kill, and it's not a surprising card any more.\n\nI think that card games still need to be interesting (have hard, interesting choices) when you can't build a deck. In other words, the big choices in Magic are when you build a deck, and the choices you make while playing a deck are much smaller. I think that card games are only good when your choices are excruciating, and Magic is rarely excruciating. Magic is mostly just \"oh well, I guess I just win/lose\".\n\nAlso, decks are expensive? I might have dumped an extra $40 or $50 into my one precon by now? I hate the pricing of this game.\n\n==2022/04/14==\nI have a few local friends who love EDH, and I like playing EDH with them because I like spending time with them. Magic is easy enough to play (now that I know the rules?), so I'll never turn down a game. But, I'm still struggling to say that Magic is a good game.\n\nMost modern deck-vs-deck games either provide several fixed decks for players to choose from, or they give you a set of preconstructed decks that you have the option of customizing later. Magic is such a wide space, and decks are expensive (at least premade commander decks). Simply having \"a deck\" isn't good enough, because power level varies so broadly, and each deck needs tools to deal with anything you throw at it.\n\nFor example, every deck needs both tools for combat damage (creatures) and tools for removal (not creatures). Every deck needs flyers or creatures with reach (who can block flyers). Every deck needs draw power. Every deck needs... something.\n\nOn the one hand, you definitely need everything in these categories, which makes deckbuilding hard. And also, you might not draw the tools you need, because card draw in Magic is so hard.\n\nBut more importantly, the reason that the game has all these tools (flying, combat damage, removal...) is because the game isn't /about/ anything. There's no core mechanic -- something like an auction, or rock-paper-scissors, or word-association, or inductive logic. The extensive game elements are just papering over a dry mechanical framework.\n\nGranted, the game was designed in 1993. I'm looking at a base engine that came from 1993 as if it was a modern game, which is probably not fair to Richard Garfield. I'm sure Netrunner is more interesting, because it has actual bluffs, actual mind games, and the resources are pulled out of the deck and into currency.\n\nAll this to say: A friend of mine wanted to test a new deck of his, so he gave me a white angel deck made out of bulk commons. I hate piloting this white angel deck, even though I was winning by a lot (45-ish to 25-ish?) when I forfeited so that I could head home and sleep.\n\nWhen I'm playing Saheeli's Exquisite Invention (the deck I own, gifted to me by a friend, which has lots of combos and stuff), I have a good time and the game experience is like an 8. When I'm playing my friend's white angel deck, the game experience is like a 2 and I wonder what I'm doing with my life.\n\n==2022/03/26==\nI played EDH again, and it was fine. The game didn't drag out too long, but that was mainly because: A) it was a two-player EDH game, and B) my deck was apparently quite a bit stronger than my opponent's. I'm still not convinced that I could enjoy 4-player EDH unless it was shorter.\n\nI'm getting my own commander deck soon because it's rising in popularity with my friends, and I'm wondering if I can't upgrade it to make the deck more effective and the games shorter.\n\n==2019/05/19==\n1) I have no idea what's going on during my opponent's turns, and I can't keep track of their board states.\n\n2) Counterplay doesn't feel important. my opponent does stuff, it puts obstacles in front of my engine, and then I try to figure out if I can overcome what they just did to me.\n\n2b) The game doesn't feel like it has counterplay designed into it. I have ridiculous things, my opponents have ridiculous things, and they butt heads. I don't know if I have an answer to my opponent or not; the game gives me the freedom (through deck construction) to omit answers to my opponent.\n\n2c) Also, the large deck size of EDH and slow draw rate means that I might not draw into my answers. ugh!!!\n\n3) There's no potential for comebacks. Clever plays aren't enough to get myself out of a bad spot. There's no tension or excitement when I know that I'm firmly losing.\n\n\n==2019/02/09=\nSo, just played my first full-fledged EDH 4-player game with a prebuilt deck I actually like and sorta know how to use. Here are new thoughts:\n\n0) Shuffling a 100-card deck is fine, now that I've had practice.\n\n1) The cards do have really cool combos, which I like. However, the possibility space doesn't diverge fast enough to feel like I have interesting choices.\n\n2) Mana screw doesn't feel like a big deal; mana felt easy to draw. However, drawing into the wrong color of mana felt like it was a common problem across all players.\n\n3) There is no balance. Kailin paid 6 mana to wipe all artifact creatures. My deck was 100% artifacts, so I had basically zero board state afterward. Any semblance of balance in Magic is a lie, plainly and simply.\n\n4) Downtime is outrageous, even when playing with players who know the game and mostly know their decks. The game took 3 hours (9:30pm to 12:30am).\n\n5) \"Table politics\" means \"bash the leader.\"\n\n\n==2019/01/12==\nMy friends are trying to fix the \"your hand plays itself\" part of Magic by building me a Planeswalker commander deck. Planeswalkers have multiple uses and currency management, which I like.\n\nRight now (before playing said deck), Magic feels like a game about using the synergies already there rather than devising cool combos on the fly. It's a game about tracking and understanding text effects across the board.\n\nWell, maybe I did devise some combos last game, but they felt dry. Hrm. Not sure why.\n\n==2018/11/28==\n0) Why do I have to design my own deck? Shouldn't that be the designer's job?\n\n1) All decks are not necessarily at the same power level. Players are responsible for balancing their own decks against each other.\n\n2) Every deck requires a handful of standard functionality to counter strategies that their opponents might be using. (Compare \"rapid spinners\" in Pokemon video games.)\n\n3) Mana screw. Sometimes you need lands but don't draw them.\n\n4) Decks are expensive. A cheap EDH deck is $12 minimum. An Exceed character is $7.50 MSRP.\n\n5) Multiplayer EDH looks like it relies on a mix of mechanics and table politics. Why not play Cosmic Encounter, where the game doesn't pretend to be about mechanics?\n\n6) Shuffling a 100-card deck sucks.\n\n==2018/02/??==\nThe \"this is interesting!\" spark of Magic seems to be deck construction. Your hand seems to play itself in-game.",

    "comment": "Theory crafting a deck is way more fun than actually playing the game, and the ratio of having fun watching your decks work versus being frustrated by bad draws and the horrible resource system makes the game pretty unfulfilling.\n\nIt's quite frequent that within the game's design you might not be able to actually play the game. It's baffling. They keep trying out different mulligan rules as a bandaid for that fundamental flaw, but the bandaids don't really work all that well, and they mostly just highlight how poor of a design it is. Don't try to point that out to the faithful though, or you'll get a heaping dose of sunk cost fallacy.\n\nI've also noticed that the competitiveness is far more adversarial and personal than in a lot of other games, because you're competing not only within the game space, but also within a meta understanding of that game space, as well as a financial meta. Doing poorly is a combination of suboptimal play, luck, lack of dedication/capacity to researching the meta, and lack of ability to afford competitive decks. This all coalesces in fostering a quite toxic culture of gaming classism and elitism that makes the game incredibly unfriendly to people who aren't willing or able to commit heavily into the game. Even the more casual formats are becoming increasingly competitive and expensive.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that Magic is more of a lifestyle/culture than it is a game at this point. As a game it's a poorly designed, pay-to-win, fiddly, rules bloated nightmare with very little reward for the investment it requires. But as a culture none of that matters.",

The turn sequence and victory conditions are pretty constraining, and feel really flat compared to games like Android: Netrunner, Doomtown Reloaded or Legend of the Five Rings. The Magic lore is a hot mess, but doesn't seem particularly important to anyone playing anyway, which is a disappointment for me. And the collectible distribution format is just untenable.\nAfter buying about a half dozen different bundles and deck builder kits, I gave 'em away to a friend who plays.",

After Tempest block went out (I started with Mirage) I gave up on constructed formats and have only played the game on sealed tournaments up to Odyssey (when I ran out of money and shifted to DnD).\n\nLooking back on it - now, being older, I understand deck building better than I did then, and it totally doesn't interest me as it's too gamey. I much prefer games where I'm allowed to think on the spot and make decisions during the game, with some tactical options as well as strategic ones. In ye olde times we did have some more original illustrators. Anyhow, I hope I can get rid of the cards (baggage).\n\nAnd oh yeah, CCG format sucks.",

    "comment": "There is no game that has had as much an effect on me as Magic: The Gathering.\n\nThis is not an uncritical endorsement. There are many parts of MtG that are deeply flawed. Randomized packs. The predatory rotation cycle. Deep undercurrents of sexism in the community. All of these are very severe flaws that would damn another game for me.\n\nThat being the case, please understand that it is with an awareness of these flaws that I still rate MtG a ten.\n\nI played since I was around 9 or 10 years old, starting out with my sister crushing me over and over with a faeries deck that I could not figure out how to beat. I played casually for years after that, before starting out a streak of competitive play around 2012/2013. This took off around 2014/2015, and it got to the point that on any given evening, I was more likely than not at a tournament of some sort.\n\nMy specialty was drafting, and I dare say I got to be a player that was (at least locally) considered pretty good. I could consistently 4-0 or 3-0 online pods and local tournaments.\n\nEventually, I realized I had to give it up. The time I was sinking in had led to me jumping significantly in skill, but the next step would have been committing whole hog. I'd have to drop other games, play competitively online, and likely get into a local testing group to really jump to the next level. I had a wife, friends who really didn't care about Magic, and a demanding job. I let the dream go, and gradually began spinning off my collection.\n\nMagic taught me a lot in my time with it. I never thought that I could have gotten as far as I did, and it gave me a lot of confidence in my ability to learn and improve. The regimented method of always looking for holes in my game, and the ability to suppress my emotions to continue playing for my best shot to win has carried over into my life. I feel that I have become better at assessing my own performance, not just in games, but also in day to day life. I'm patient with my own mistakes (or at least, more than I used to be), and I am much better at hearing criticism than I used to be. All these things came from my time playing competitive Magic, along with countless other gifts and lessons I haven't listed here.\n\nMagic is a deeply flawed game in many respects. There are countless barriers to entry, and there are very serious questions about the ethics of its business model. It is still impossible for me to not rank it a 10. If something that was so formative for me and that I played for so long through so much of my life isn't a ten, what is?\n\nEdit:\nAfter reconsidering, I'm going to drop this to a 6, which more accurately represents my willingness to play the game nowadays. I still deeply appreciate the joy and learning MtG brought me, but if I'm rating according to BGG's scale, I rarely want to play anymore.\n\nEdit the Second:\n...and lo, it has dropped lower. I played EDH with some friends, and I was surprised how little enjoyment I had. Most of the game seemed to be based around how many complex decision trees people could think through, but they weren't particularly compelling. You can really see the Cosmic Encounter roots in multiplayer MtG, and the descent of my CE rating mirrors this one.",

Besides being the first game of its type, the mechanics of the game were far more interesting and playtested than many other of the tabletop games out there released during that erra.\n\nHowever, nearly 25 years later, I can say that this game is simply not that good compared to what's out there.\n\nResources to summon your creatures or cast spells require luck of the draw, which is an already a red flag for a poorly designed game. Games like WoW CCG or Hearthstone fixed this problem.\n\nIn regards to balance, because Magic the Gathering is reliant on expansions that continue on forever, expect some cards to be either outdated and outclassed due to constant power creeps. Some cards are simply inferior to others. This especially true for land cards, with some of them allowing two different colors instead of one. It's a pay 2 win scheme with some of the worst tournament payouts compared to eSports games.\n\nMagic the Gathering is an interesting relic but it is not a good game. Many games like Netrunner, Hearthstone, and Codex have been proven to work on the foundations of Magic and improved on it greatly with far less expenses involved.",

By domino effect, this game was caused me to eventually meet my fiancé.\n\nThis game means so much to me, but over the years, the insane power creep, universe beyond sets and story of the game have really gone down hill.\n\nI really miss the days where we were able to enjoy planes in 3 block sets that took place for almost a year, it really felt like an event when we moved onto the next plane. I would day dream so much to where we would go to next.\n\nGoing from Standard, to Modern, the EDH and to Pioneer, there are a ton of ways I've enjoyed to play the game. But these days the balance of the game is kind of wack. I'm certainly not the only one who feels this way.\n\nDeck construction used to feel like such a joy. It really made me feel clever to put certain cards into a deck and watch my gameplan pay off from a decision that I've made outside the game.\n\nThe price of entry to the game is a little messed up too. If you want to have a competitive deck to play in any format, get ready to spend upwards of 300 dollars. At one point I had a commander deck that was around 5k.\n\nAfter selling out of the game, there hasn't been much of a reason to go back into the game. I'd just get bodied by whatever is broken nowadays. Brackets wont save commander. Trying to play standard through Arena asks too much of an investment to play. Nobody plays either pioneer or modern anymore. Pauper is nonexistent.\n\nCommander used to be a lot of fun for me back in 2012 - 2018. Pioneer and Standard too. Duel commander was the last format I enjoyed until I got tired of the game. The entire game became a dick measuring contest.

    "comment": "I played MTG quite a bit with my brothers & friends when I was younger, but as I got older I found that it became a game dominated by metaknowledge. Either you put in an inordinate amount of time memorizing as many cards as possible (and purchasing the best ones, sometimes for a considerable fee), or you're at a huge disadvantage. Playing against more knowledgeable players is also often unpleasant, because they tend play so quickly that I don't have enough time to read the rules-text on the cards that they play (which is often quite a lot of rules-text). Even when one has the opportunity to read all of the cards, it's hard to keep it all straight in your head, since they all work differently. To top it off, additional sets released not only add new cards, but also new *types* of cards, new keywords, and in some cases change preexisting cards (which, of course, is not reflected in the actual text of the copies you're likely to already have). The result is a game of extreme rules complexity... that just isn't enjoyable enough to warrant the level of dedication it demands. Still, it's fun to draft a deck from time-to-time if you play with someone who's knowledgeable enough to answer your questions, but isn't so competitive that they feel like they're above playing against less experienced players.",

My biggest problem is the way the game has been handled over the last 15 years. It's turned into a \"how can we squeeze as much money out of the players as possible.\" I didn't mind buying cards occasionally and I did participate in tournaments, which is what caused the need to spend money. However, over time, Hasbro has injected themselves into EDH and other corners of the game to try to get their share of the $. It's just too costly and they're constantly churning out products making decks no longer worth playing due to their being outclassed by newer cards.",

There are an enormous number of possible interactions, and the game is very adaptable in both playing time and playing style, so I tend to think of it as more of a toolbox than as one single game.\n\nSometimes, though, especially recently, it takes a lot of effort to weed out the bad parts. I particularly dislike the planeswalker card type, which in most cases is extremely annoying to play with or against. In addition, the game has become much worse at keeping power creep in check, and there is often too much rules text on the cards, which slows down the game and makes gameplay kind of clunky.\n\nI'm also not very fond of multiplayer free-for-all, since it depends on leader-bashing and overly rewards slow and passive play.\n\nDrafting the Ravnica and Time Spiral blocks was very fun, though.",

I get the allure of it all, but it's not for me. I know there are various formats to address and handle this, but bleh.

It does allow for enable a wide diversity of things which has kept the game so playable and fresh for so many for so long, but Magic is very much a lifestyle game that asks a ton of commitment from its players to truly shine, and I've never been compelled to do so, hence why it gets such a tepid rating from me.",

Simply, too much of Magic's core design is frustrating and dated by modern game design standards (namely the land system and combat).

Great idea of using resource land cards to play other cards. But these great ideas were combined with marketing ideas of collectibility (the very worst form of it: punishing rarity combined with blind purchase), which made it seem like much more of a collector’s product than a game (but from a marketing/profit perspective, this was also brilliant). The game itself, using mostly non-rare cards, was addictive and fun, but ultimately a bit too repetitive and limited. 80% of the game’s strategy seems to go into deckbuilding (pre-game strategy) rather than gameplay (tactics), so that in-game decisions seemed mostly trivial, which to me is not as compelling--but is obviously a way to get players to buy more cards since that’s the main way to get more options and strategy from game to game. For example, gameplay is very limited since players cant replenish played cards very fast and so have few options in the mid- to late game. Another poor design feature is the randomness of drawing land, which is the essential resource in every game. The game may have improved since those early years.",

    "comment": "A rather messy, random game. There are two main ways to play the game, each with its own problems:\n\n* \"Limited\", of which I played Draft. Each player spends c. £10 on brand new cards, which go round the table, players pick one card at a time. You can already see one problem there, although it's actually the cheaper way to play. The decks you build with the cards you pick will probably be fairly random, with few cards repeating in a deck. You will probably try to choose cards that work somewhat well together in a deck but fancy combos are out of the question. Some mechanics may be hard to take advantage of at all (I found the recently re-introduced snow lands rather useless).\n\n* \"Constructed\", where players come with the decks they've built from their collections. This is where the proper game begins, this is what hardcore players spend their time and money on. The requirement on time and money is also what I personally object the most. On one hand, this is where you can really put your mind to work, as well the cards you collected through playing Limited games, and try to conjure up a perfectly synchronised deck to win all your games. On the other hand, you are going lose to someone who got their deck on the internet. It's not cheating, it's \"metagame\", and is a big part of MtG. If you want to beat them by playing an even stronger deck from the internet, you need to be prepared to spend a lot of dough on rare cards (and remember you typically need 4 copies).\n\nOK, you're playing Limited or Constructed, doesn't matter. You've got yourself a deck you're happy with, you've got a clear strategy in your head, and an idea on how to counter your opponent's moves. You're ready to go. What you forget though is that you're still playing a card game, and you lose if you don't draw the cards you need. No lands? Too many lands? All you can do is watch how your opponent beats you.\n\nPros:\n* Artwork\n* Some interesting mechanics\n* Can be fun, if luck is on your side\n\nCons:\n* Randomness\n* Mana screw\n* Aggressive monetisation\n* Metagame\n* Learning curve\n* Unethical design? Opening a new pack of cards has an element of gambling to it and is clearly designed to get you hooked and spending money.",

The perpetual “cash grab” cycle of expansions makes it difficult to fully enjoy without heavy investment.

The game might seem intimidating at first, but with the right introduction (a good friend or Duels of the Planeswalkers) you get into it right away. The game is all about the community, so if you find the right play group, you will get sucked right in. I'm a casual player myself, so I try and make the community as accessible as possible where I live. And it doesn't have to be expensive. I only spend roughly 100$ on it annually. (9.5) - 2015-08-20\n\nWith the abundance of other games I've played since (other collectables included), the shine has worn off. The land system in Magic is so infuriating that I can't ignore how many games (especially limited) have been an almost coin toss, because of being mana screwed. Played a draft recently, where 8 out 11 matches were heavily influenced by drawing the wrong (amount) of lands. (8 - 7-2019)\n\nI can't with Magic anymore. With Universes Beyond taking up so much space, with almost every card being a wall text and most non-Universe Beyond sets being uninteresting costume party sets, there's not much left to make me care. And with Star Wars Unlimited cementing how luck-prone and frustrating lands and lacking card draw is, Magic has gone from the absolute best game I've ever known, to a frustrating, expensive reminder of how far we've come since with game design.",

    "comment": "I've gone back and forth on this game many times over the course of my life. I dislike the TCG business model, but in practice, history has borne out that there is no comparable alternative if you want a game with the variety, scope, ability to support a game store, and built-in community of a collectible game. LCGs seem great on the surface, but as time goes on, the barrier to entry grows, often encouraging you to spend full price on boxes that might only have one card you need. Magic decks can be expensive, but the price of building one viable competitive deck, while usually high, doesn't tend to increase drastically over time. LCGs also have too many SKUs for stores to reliably support all but the truly successful ones, of which there have been remarkably few, and none of which have been competitive games (much love to Netrunner and Null Signal, of course). Not to mention that limited formats like draft become a whole other beast in an LCG.\n\nWhile the booster pack model is an uncomfortable proposition for a competitive game, it also undeniably allows for an entire ecosystem of formats that simply can't exist with another business model. Customizable games ultimately need to be lifestyle games, not necessarily for ALL players (the best ones also have some degree of casual accessibility), but at least for some. Those players who invest the most are the ones a game like this depends on, not just in terms of revenue, but also in terms of cultivating a dedicated, passionate community. The time and effort investment of building decks and keeping a local scene churning is substantial, and the players who are willing to engage that for a more restrictive board-game-plus-expansions model are few and far between. Sure, Summoner Wars is fantastic, and you can even build your own decks, but the time and effort needed just to find other players willing to do the same will already turn away many of the players who would otherwise love to engage with the game on that level. And those who stick around aren't as likely to do so, not because the game is worse (it really isn't), but because something like Summoner Wars offers much less variety and much less shakeup in its card pool by virtue of not releasing a handful of 300+ card sets every year.\n\nTurning a card game into a lifestyle game is also much more attainable when players can push back burnout by playing a variety of modes with the same product. Being able to draft one week, then plug the cards you pulled into your standard deck the next week, then tweak your commander deck the next softens the blow of your investment dramatically. Magic: The Gathering's dominance is not just a matter of its game or card design (though it's still better than a number of its competitors in those regards), but in the versatility of its systems. It's not just a lifestyle game, it's several lifestyle games. And these games, at least for some players, are entirely extricable--look how many Magic players nowadays don't bother with anything but Commander, a format originally made by fans to play with bigger groups and give new life to their card collections. It's easy to quit playing one game, but are you going to quit playing all of them? Even putting aside sunk costs and a desire to maintain friend groups bound by the game, there are a lot of justifications for holding onto, or jumping back into, Magic that don't exist for other games.\n\nWhile ultimately, I think most of the best games out there nowadays are board and card games that fit in a single box--or RPGs that spring forth from a single book and a group's shared imagination--there is something to be said for the sprawl and vigor of a trading card game. There are absolutely board games that can achieve some of the appeals of a TCG, but never all at once. So while the business model was once my chief complaint about Magic, these days, it's just the design. There are other card games that I think are fun enough to warrant looking past the booster pack, or even embracing it. Magic is a design which groans under decades of weight. The designers shepherding MTG these days are incredibly talented and constantly putting out interesting cards that make the most of its systems. Yet every time I play Magic, I can't help but wonder if the land system is going to give me an unwinnable nongame. I can't help but get a bit lost at the walls of text on my opponent's cards, forcing me to guess at new keywords the graphic design hasn't done anything to pick out. I can't help but sigh at the thought of guessing what instants even exist in the game now anytime my opponent ends their turn with open resources.\n\nThese days, I'm playing Star Wars: Unlimited. That game, while a bit cheaper than the worst of Magic, still has its share of too-expensive pieces of cardboard. But for once in my life, I'm having enough fun with a collectible game to justify the cost.",

Even in modern (2019!) beginner pre-built decks, I still found half of the (2-color deck) games I played suffered from this. It's just not fun, and it feels like the win/loss is based on our draws rather than superior strategy. Likewise for needing to draw something to counter a Flying creature, etc. Mulligan helps, but a more fundamental fix is needed imo.\n- I'm strongly opposed to the idea of pay-to-win games. It's a major balance issue, and just not a lot of fun (i.e. when budget can dominate skill, this is far worse than winning by dumb luck). Fixed decks handle this, but that eliminates the deckbuilding, which is where most of the strategy lies.\n\nVery similar to Android: Netrunner in terms of weaknesses, and even somewhat in terms of strategy / strengths, so I'm having trouble articulating why I rank that one higher. Perhaps because there are more ways to circumvent bad draws (e.g. draw cards faster, various servers to attack, etc)? Plus no random expansion packs (less of a money drain)?\n\nUpdate: Order has reversed. Though I played A:N far more, so we'll see what happens over time.",

I will still play once in awhile, typically draft (limited or cube), or EDH/Commander, but I'm honestly left feeling overloaded after a couple of games and would have preferred to have done something else instead upon reflection.\n\nNonetheless, I think Magic is objectively a terrific game, but if one is going to jump in, they can't rush it.

You might think it's unfair to rate the game based on that, but the meta is really important in this game, and they do affect it. Maybe some closed format can change my mind, but this is my rating, for now.\n\n---\n\nOk, so I still think Wizards is full of shit, and Devir is irresponsible at best. I still have mixed feelings about the local stores. But the game is great! It's got strategy, it's got tactics. It's so massively rich and complex it can be overwhelming, but usually you don't face it all at once. And there are affordable formats, mind you.\n\nSome people might be turned off by deck construction. It's a lot of work, and it's a solitary activity. But it's solitary with an interactive purpose - you're mindful of what you know others are playing. In fact, deck construction might be more interactive that some games people play...\n\n---\n\nA friend of mine is always complaining about mana screw. But not only does he take a very simplistic approach to balancing mana in his deck, but he also doesn't shuffle thoroughly. Seriously, people, you need to do some filter shuffling, and then some normal shuffling.\n\n---\n\nI like Pauper for three reasons.\n1- Yes, some cards will cost more than others. Supply and demand. That is acceptable. But the rarity system, that creates artificial scarcity of the strongest cards, is not. The way to avoid that is to play commons only.\n2- As a consequence of the above, Pauper is much more affordable than other formats.\n3- I actually like the reduced power level of common cards (on average, relative to other rarities). It gives the game a slower, step by step pace. I'm not too fond of bombs.",

This game has so much going for it, but is just stupid expensive. I was excited by the opportunity to play for free when Arena came out, but the F2P economy just forces you to sink absurd amounts of time into the game in order to keep up.\n\nLimited (draft/sealed) is my absolute favorite way to play. The fact that you can play absolutely optimally and it still has a bit of that kitchen-table feel of slapping big creatures on the table and making sub-optimal cards pull a ton of weight is just delightful.\n\nFor a time I loved that Commander allowed exploration of more under-utilized cards and mechanics from the game's history, but the power level is so variable and trying to calibrate expectations for a table of 4 people usually ends in disappointment. 4 player with inflated life totals funnels the entire player-base towards a handful of similar and predictable win conditions.\n\nStandard is probably my favorite constructed format just by nature of being lower power level and enabling more exploration of less-busted cards, but around the time I quit playing WotC was making huge mistakes in pushing power level and had to ban a card from Standard with nearly every new set release, so that wasn't quite doing it for me.\n\nDraft would honestly be a 10/10 for me, but it's just too costly, and learning each new set is too big of a time investment if you're not going to be playing often.",

The replayability is derived almost entirely from the novelty of seeing what decks you can design and testing them against each other. The game requires a constant influx of new cards to keep it interesting.\n\nThere is also a huge learning curve if you want to play the game correctly as many keywords and abilities do not work how you would expect. For example:\nA creature can be indestructible; this means that the creature cannot take damage or be \"destroyed\" BUT if the creature has enough -1 counters placed on it to reduce it's toughness to 0 it can still die.\nThe game is full of little things like this that make it very hard to learn.",

I still like commander, but keeping up with standard, or even drafting, has really falling off for me. A lot of this has to do with the way the game design has changed in recent years, power creep, focus on creatures, etc. I will always love Magic for getting me into gaming and being my favorite game for a long time, but it's no longer the game for me.",

The set rotations, powercreep, and focus on the tournament scene pretty much killed me as a customer. (Though, sure, I can't deny the tournament scene is probably a large part of what's kept the game selling for twenty years.) The majority of cards I have are from the small horde I amassed during the game's first couple years, and I've added only a handful of newer cards to that in the last two decades.\n\nStill, if you can avoid the tournament scene and the more cutthroat play, this can be a pretty decent game - fun, fast, easy to teach, easy to transport, and with some really cool art.\n\n(((However I felt about this company previously, they seem to have really gone off the rails in the last five years, especially in regards to their handling of this game.

My best friend, Aaron, taught me the game at his dining room table around 1994, and I still remember laughing at some of the flavor text. Eventually, we moved on to other card games and tabletop RPGs, but MTG remained on my radar, its influence growing ever larger as I attended various game conventions over the years.\n\nWhen Duskmourn was released, with its evocative ’80s horror vibe, I decided to revisit what has since become both a classic and a behemoth in the industry. I was happy to find that the gameplay still holds up, with even greater depth in complexity and theme. New formats like Pauper and Commander seem to be the billows fanning the flames that keep this game red-hot. Magic continues to thrive, and I’m glad to be along for the ride once again—fun!",

Trop de cartes, trop de mauvaises cartes, trop d'emballage, trop d'argent à investir, trop de temps à consacrer à concocter des decks, trop de situations où les probabilités de gain / de défaite sont loin du 50-50 avant même d'amorcer une partie, et trop souvent de l'amertume (et un désir d'investir davantage d'argent et de temps dans le jeu) lorsque l'on connaît une mauvaise soirée.\n\nMagic sera toujours un jeu très important pour moi, mais 8.2 signifie ici \"would suggest it\".

But there are so many ways I hate to interact with it.\n\nI'm not a fan of Commander at all. But Draft and Sealed? Great. Modern is too absurd with its power creep and it's an eternal format that is no longer eternal because new crazy sets just invalidate such huge swaths of the card pool. But Standard (and I've heard similar about Pioneer), where scope is far more contained and power creep far better tested? Sign me up (as long as the rotation isn't currently bad for Standard, which it's not).\n\nMana screw and deck bricking aren't enough to shut this game down from being as strong as it is, flaws and all.",

Unfortunately, I have no time or need for a lifestyle game at this point, and although I miss playing at times, I do not miss having to find 4 of every card from every new set every couple months in order to stay competitive. Nostalgia -- that's what this game is for me now. But thanks for the memories.\n\n*edit - suckered in for one more go around. It started with MtG: Arena. It's a very convenient format for both collecting and playing. With significantly less cost than the paper version, I can build and play competitive decks. The game overall (MtG) is in a great place right now. Standard is better than at any time I ever played. It's hard to believe this game is as good as it is right now after so long.\n\nPerhaps this is actually my favorite game ever. It's just really hard to compare to board games - feels like two completely different hobbies, so I'm uncertain about ranking MtG within my favorites.",

It is still the most addictive game I know and I've played thousands of matches between 1996 and 2003. At that point I had grown weary of the increasingly competitive nature of the community which wasn't that interested in casual play and toying with weird deck ideas. Also I didn't fancy the direction the game was going to. Originally players were the magicians, today they just play cards and there are these unneeded things called planeswalkers/commanders/whatevs. Originally the art was interesting and varied, today it is just bland and generic fantasy art. M:tG has become just seldom fun for me.\n\nMy all time favorite formats are T1, T1.5, Cube draft, Highlander and drafting from a commons box.\n\nMy all time favorite deck types to play have been WW, 5C No hand control (which was ruined somewhat by the removal of mana burn) that you could maybe call \"Hellbent\" with today's terms, G control with big hitters, G LD with lots of mana elves, U Snake Basket with varied artifact mana generation, Browse-Digger, RW Landkill, and 5C Counter madness utilizing Giant Fan.\n\nMy all time favorite card is probably Eladamri's Vineyard.\n\nI don't have any playable decks anymore, the last one having been a WW Highlander. All the cards I own are for sale.",

The design is stunning and clear allowing focus on other aspects of the game. Component rating: 9/10\nThe setup is fast and easy. Setup rating: 8/10\nThe game is a little more complex. The mechanics unfortunately are really complicated and very in depth. The base rules are simple and easy to read but the full rules and interactions are extremely complex. Difficulty rating: 3/10\nWith around 30 000 different cards combinations are endless and so is replaybility. Replayibility rating: 10/10.\nUnfortunately even beginner commander decks so called precons retail for easily 50EUR or more making this game difficult to compete if one cant buy cards. 6/10\n\nI think this is something you can really get into but the price tag can be very restrictive. It’s a fun game that can be played with friends and strangers at conventions alike but it really feels like the biggest wallet wins and not the best player.\n\nNote: Difficulty rating games that are extremely complicated to the point where it’s difficult to understand what to do will get a lower rating. While easy to understand games will get a higher rating. Game complexity is not game difficulty.",

To narrow it down a bit, I decided to focus on Forests and Plains, and my son focussed on Mountains and Islands, and we gave ourselves a small budget not to go over. We will only ever play casually, so it's possible to build a fun deck without having to harvest one of our kidneys, haha. Looking forward to exploring the card synergies more",

    "comment": "I'll jump right into pros and cons for people deciding whether or not it's worth it to dive into this TCG and it's many rules and formats.\n\nPros:\n\n- you only need one other player and you can play it online for free (Magic Arena online)\n- a 1on1 game can be played fairly quickly and as there are so many different card combinations most likely no games are alike\n- the more group oriented format EDH or Commander can be played with 4 people and you can buy any of the recent pre constructed commander decks to dive right in. BUT: Beware as Commander is a little more complicated as you have to be aware of more cards effects at once. Even for experienced players it can get pretty messy and confusing at times\n- Constant new releases keep the game fresh, even if it comes at a price. If you find the right group to draft new sets with, it is going to be a blast though!\n- Drafts are really where this game shines in my opinion and if you got a group of 8 to share a box it comes at an acceptable price. Even more so if you use some of those cards to build another format called cube to draft more in the future. Another cheap alternative might be Pauper.\n\nCons:\n\n- Its Pay2win. Literally. Sure there is skill involved but if you do not set up rules in your group you might face up against someone with more money and be defeated in no time = boring. However if you keep some of your cards long enough, some might go up substantially in value, so checking out tcgplayer or cardmarket.com might be worth it once in a while.\n- The resource system is terribly outdated. Yes I know they are trying to fix the manaflood or manadrain symptome with different new abilites, but let's face it: it is still a mess. If you are playing a 1on1 and either player draws too many lands (thus no playable cards to interact) or too few lands or not in the right colors (thus cannot play his interactive cards) there is no game. Literally. You draw a land. can't do anything. Next player does something with value. Rinse repeat for 4 turns until the \"game\" is over. Terrible outdated design. What's even worse is: BOTH players have to draw a balanced amount of lands to interactive cards for a game to take place. The chances are 1/6 ?\nIt's just laughable. We are using a houserule special mixing technique in our group to prevent this nonsense waste of time: shuffle all creatures all lands and all other cards in 3 separate piles. create 8 stacks in front of you by placing first 8 creatures 1 on each pile, then 8 lands one on each pile, then 1 other card on each pile. Rinse repeat. That's it. You still don't know what's coming, but at least you have a greater chance of having a game. Because guess what, that's still not guaranteed.\n- Mulligan. If you draw poorly you might as well surrender instantly. At least that's my experience after 1000+ games. 90% of the time, if you have to mulligan (meaning draw again and remove one card, next time if it is still bad, draw again and remove 2 cards etc.) you start hand with one less card because your opening hand was terrible (too high cost cards or not enough right mana lands) its pretty much game because your opponent hast card advantage. This is more true vs skilled players than vs newbies.\n- Discard. The Mill mechanic is somewhat fun because it let's you race for alternative win conditions, one player trying to make you empty your draw pile into your discad pile (graveyard) faster than you can bring his total life sum to zero. But discard? For yourself to discard a card and draw a card sure. But force your opponents to discard 2 cards? That's often game in a 1on1. Its a stupid mechanic that removes decisions from a game. You'll end up with no hand cards and are played by the game instead of having any meaningful decision left to yourself. draw the top card and play it (if possible) We've banned discard opponents hand cards more than 1 from our group. A game is good when you have meaningful and interesting choices/decisions. If a game takes those away it is badly designed. It's that simple. This is on par with roll&move where pure dumb luck decides whether you can take part in a game or not. In My eyes: Waste of time.\n\nSo now you know it. A little house rules and a little money, a chill group of people to play with and this can be a blast and bring a wide variety of different types of decks. Just look at edhrec to get a glimpse of the many possiblities of how to design a deck. Other than that it can be incredibly frustrating, especially in magic arena online, where those house rules are not implemented and you cannot take back something you clicked because you misread one word in the bazillion lines of text on those 10 cards. Which is another kind of recent problem: Cards are getting way too much text.",

    "comment": "I play commander and horde (rule 0) formats only for now. So far, in these 5 months I've had so much fun, both deckbuild and gameplay wise. I've also been playing it with myself, by controlling 2, 3, or even 4 decks. The game (format) is just that good. I don't plan ever starting to play standard format because that's what I've ran away from. I've played Yugioh for almost 15 years, and I've finally had enough. The game died for me a couple years ago, but was still playing it until March (?) of 2024. I believe MTG's standard format is like Yugioh.\n\nNow, the game can be REALLY expensive if you want it to be. Talking about commander here. You can build a 4000+$ deck, or you can build a 50$ one. Depends what you want to create/play and what bracket system (power level) are you interested in playing. I'm still considered myself as a newbie here, but my personal advice would be to avoid playing CEDH (bracket 5), and maybe even bracket 4? Not sure about it. I'm optimizing all of my decks around bracket 3 (because I believe that's the sweetspot for both deckbuilding skill, strategy, and fun you get out from commander), and I like to keep them in the price range of 200 to 300$.\n\nI'll still give it an 8-star rating because of the Universes Beyond thing. I personally don't think they should be pushing a lot of these into MTG worlds. It just looks silly. More power to you if you like it. Have fun, I'm sure you will anyhow. Just want to adress what I, and a lot of other players, think about this. Also, in commander, try not to be that person who has to win at any cost. You'll quickly become the nemesis and more often than not, kil*ed off the table quickly. Just have fun, and don't ruin it for yourself.",

Fantasy Flight's LCG concept is an improvement (at least in my book). If MTG went to something like that, I'd probably be back on this like stink on a turd. I like the game, but not the commercial execution.\n\nCame back to it in 2022 and 2023. Again, was lots of fun with the right group. Commander was best. But I don't like keeping up with the new releases, and playing with the same decks (while fixing the chase aspect) can get tedious since then it is a race to executing your known strategy more efficiently than your opponents (and their known strategies). In fairness, the game itself is probably the best game I've played. The growth is what gives me problems. And those are my problems, not so much the game's.\n\nStrangely, I think this game would be a 10/10 if I were just rating it on the quality of the game rather than my desire to play.

The lands approach makes it so that games are not consistent, it can be easy to win or lose due to how mana is drawn (and mulligans are punishing enough to make that hard to fix).\n2. It is expensive. There are some extremely expensive cards out there. And some of them are essentially necessary for competitive play. Because of how popular it is, and because of high MSRP, even casual starter sets or commander decks can demand a really high price.\n\nIt is probably not my favorite TCG mechanically (that is Star Wars Unlimited) and nit the most accessible (that is Disney Lorcana) but it is still great.

It's essentially become another board game on my shelf for casual play.\n\nI no longer play Winston or Winchester draft for 2 players, preferring the 15 pack Dark Draft.\n\nhttp://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/the-cube-forum/1...\n\nDark Draft\nhttps://www.epiccardgame.com/formats-draft/",

And maybe that some day, I'll take the time to write some verbose context for the Magic that I love. In the meantime, this praise is *not* to be read as a recommendation. If you are considering picking up MTG, the game you are going to play is realistically not the game that I'm rating. The subsets of Magic that I love are for all intents and purposes functionally dead, abandoned, and amongst the millions of active MTG players, maybe that a double digit amount of them would nurture more than some ephemeral nostalgia tourism towards the formats I prefer.\n\nFar more importantly, the economic model of the game has always been some non-zero level of evil, and is reportedly getting steadily worse. Veterans stating that it is possible to play Magic for cheap are simultaneously right and misleading, in that their ability to craft an enjoying and pseudo-infinitely replayable environment on a tight budget isn't accounting for the amount of time and money they've spent developing the expertise in both gameplay and secondary market avenues that have allowed them to reach the point at which the statement stands true.",

Unfortunately, the depth of gameplay comes mostly from deck construction and matchup, while playing the game itself is often (but not always) mechanical.\n\nMagic's greatest asset is its huge library of cards. However, the source of this variety - CCG economics - is also the source of Magic's greatest weakness. Not only is it be expensive, it is often hard to find players who are playing the same format that you are, and nearly impossible to match power levels between two players' decks.\n\nRecommended way to play: Find somewhere that sells playsets of all the commons in a set, then play casual sealed/draft with that. It will be cheap and fun, and lacking the horror involved in collection and construction.",

You can only give basics and hope people will be interested to learn more themselves.\n\nAs much as I praise the game the newest moves from WotC in last couple of years not really fit my style. I stoppep buying new realeses for a long time and play commander online mostly nowdays. The amount of new fiddly mechanics that require you to counter 1000 types of tokens, venture thru dungeons, put emblems and have initiative are getting bit out of hand i belive. Not to mention the neverending at this point universe from beyond movemnt that occupy half of the year of magic releases.

Now it deserves no more than 6, due to greed and dilution.\n\nIf you're just starting to play this game, I strongly suggest you play it for free over the internet or borrow someone else's cards.

The experience is 100% what you make of it with so many different cards and game types available.\n\nWould have rated this 10 if Wizards of the Coast hadn't made so many obvious missteps in recent years.\n\nIntegrating Universes Beyond sets into all game types makes these sets unavoidable for players that dislike them. Many people appreciate the Universe and overall tone of the Magic Universe. The concept of SpongeBob facing head to head with a Lovecraftian horror that exterminates worlds is silly and spits in the face of long time players.\n\nA number of cash grabs like the Secret Lairs releases demonstrate where Wizard of the Coast's priorities lie.\n\nDespite their recent blunders, this is a very fun game to play with friends and one that you can enjoy endlessly.\n\nI recommend finding a good friend group and making an agreed upon set of rules so that everyone can have as much fun as possible!",

For anyone interested, I highly recommend learning how to make good quality proxies for casual formats.\n\nBy far the best format is cube draft. It offers a high amount of customization, from everything like art assets to gameplay style and power level. Drafting also adds a completely new dimension to the game, where limited options must be sorted and built into an effective deck. A curated cube evens the playing field on many levels, and allows for personal investment by the player who then pilots the deck that they have built.\n\nNo other game that I am aware of even comes close to the robust experience provided by this. And I say this as a long-time fan of board games.\n\nProxies sets in my collection:\nSpooky Twobert Human Module\nSpooky Twobert Monster Module\nArtifact Twobert\nDandan / Forgetful Fish",

I loved everything about it: building an idea, competing against another idea and the decisions made from those 2 in conflict. Since getting into board games: I've tried to find a substitute for this void that MTG left since I can't keep up with it (and don't really want to in these modern sets): Mage Wars, L5R, Android Netrunner, Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn among others. While I've heard of 'cubes' for MTG, I didn't fully grasp what was capable with them. My friend brought his cube and I realized that I could have a self contained cube that was full of nothing but the cards I loved as a player back in the day. EDIT: the core game is still wonderful but the modern era is flawed on both sides now: too many sets coming out and now too many people who just copy the decks that win (even if they don't understand how to play them). It now takes about 20 matches to get one that is worthwhile. Honestly, I think Commander might be the last great bastion of gameplay for MTG. All that being said: MTG is hands down the greatest game ever made for it's ability to do so much within it's ruleset",

    "comment": "Limited (Draft, Sealed), Constructed (Excluding Commander) --> ESPECIALLY NOT EDH / Commander Multiplayer, see separate rating!\n\nI love Magic. I've played it on and off (mostly on) since I first played it in 1995. I started the game playing casually 1 vs. 1 with my Mom, went on to multi-player at our local store, to competitive local tournaments in Extended and Type II (now Standard), then back to casual cubing and Dandan-ing with a friend, and EDH (now Commander) and multi-player of all-sorts with a mixed group (see separate rating for EDH). I play mostly paper and some online, with the latter going in spates now that Arena exists and is affordable for drafting on the occasions where I feel like it.\n\nI hate the economic model of Magic, it is easily the most expensive game in the world to play if you truly love it and want to have the ability to play what you want, or even the format you want (as sealed / draft is my favourite, but cubing isn't quite the same and new product is expensive as heck. That said, it is also one of the most varied and richly rewarding games ever made. No other game has sustained itself for such prolonged periods of play for me, or has weathered as many storms. Yes, I know the pure abstracts have gone on for millennia and likely will continue as such, but those are always the same game from outing to outing. The beauty of Magic and its unending releases is that as things rotate into and out of the game the strategies can evolve and change. The game today is not the same as the game with a different pool of cards 2 years from now.\n\nStrip away all of the annoyances with the economic model and what remains is one of the most deliciously subtle and varied games ever made. The game is both strategic and tactical and is full of subtle timing nuances and tricky decision trees. That all goes double when you play Limited (sealed formats) as you have to effectively build your deck on the fly and also pilot it effectively. My rating does shift, and a lot, based on what version of Magic we're talking about, as Limited (of any sort) is an easy 10 whereas Commander with 4+ players, my least favourite format ranges between 3 to 6 depending on the length of the game and the individual decks. This is for the same reason why I dislike many, much more random games: the choice of who to beat on in free-for-all formats is often arbitrary, so the game as such frequently doesn't matter and politics is all that really dictates the winner. Unfortunately, Commander is by far the most popular way to play Magic these days, so I get to it much less than I otherwise would.\n\nThat said, on an overall scale, it's hard to give this anything less than a 10 as it is one of my all-time favourite games and I am always interested in playing several different versions of it and frequently watch videos of my favourite players playing it even when I am not playing.\n\nI will simply close by saying that after 20 years+ of playing Magic I still find it fascinating and still enjoy shuffling up a new deck. I expect I will still enjoy this another 20 years from now. Fantastic design.",

No matter how bloated the MTG universe becomes, the core game is elegant, thematic, addictive, and a mesmerizing experience that draws tens of thousands of new players every year into gaming.\n\nI also appreciate this game's sheer imaginative output. Though it's obviously a collaboration among thousands of artists, there is consistency in the atmosphere it evokes, and the look and feel of the characters, places, and ideas inside this game are as rich and distinct to me as the worlds of Tolkien or other imaginative giants.",

    "comment": "Though Dungeons & Dragons is a close contender, it is likely that there was never anything more revolutionary in the history of tabletop gaming than Magic: The Gathering. Using collectible trading cards as game components was the spark of innovation, but there were many other mechanical elements to the gameplay itself that have ensured its longevity. The color pie, tapping, the mana system, the stack, top-down card designs; if you don't know what any of those things mean, I'd be happy to talk your ear off about each of them and explain how influential each has been.\n\nIt's often easy for people to conflate high-randomness with low-strategy. After all, games like Bingo are surely both. And at the opposite end of the spectrum, games like Chess are low-randomness and high-strategy. Yet we can't forget about the Pokers of the world, with obvious high-randomness while also being high-strategy enough for the most brilliant players to become multi-millionaires on the backs of their prowess. Magic also inhabits that quadrant, with tales of devastatingly bad luck sitting proudly alongside unstoppable multi-year champions. Hand management and resource management are paramount here. It is much more tense and unforgiving than many other card games. Yet it also embraces its random elements with gusto.\n\nBut of course, both at its advent as well as today, Magic had its detractors, and not without cause. Even to play casually with a group of friends can get expensive, to say nothing of trying to compete in high-level tournaments (or, heaven forbid, to be a pure collector). And certainly there is no shortage of games that tried to \"fix\" any number of perceived issues with Magic. Yet the fact that they essentially had to bill themselves as \"Magic, but...\" instead of truly innovating on the genre is itself a testament to the solid foundation of Magic's rules.\n\nAnd from the revenue generated by that initial phenomenon, an empire arose. Every illustrator working today wants a Magic contract, and consequently, the art is unparalleled. Magic is also without a doubt the most well-designed and most-playtested game in modern times. It's a testament to what devoted gamers can do with a limitless budget and full team of creative people.\n\nOver time, I have come to appreciate more and more how much this is not just a game, but a system. Don't like deckbuilding? Play pre-constructed decks. Don't like people copying the best decks? Play booster draft. Don't like spending money to draft? Build a cube. Don't like 1-on-1 duels? Play Commander or Archenemy. Don't like being so serious? Play Un-sets. A relatively simple rule set creates so many different ways to play. So much focus is put into making this game be something for everyone, that it can hardly help but succeed. There is something here for you, and you do yourself a disservice by not playing.",

However, CCGs are just too expensive to stay in.\n\nUpdate 2008: After playing a few games again, I'd forgotten how much fun this game is, in particular, the deck building. Since discovering board games, I've had my nose turned up a little at CCGs, although I've been trying other CCGs on the cheap (WoW, Vs). However, the deck building seems more directed by 'class choice' in those games and the combos aren't as interesting. If only Magic didn't have the mana screw problem!\n\nUpdate 2009: I've put together a draft cube and had amazing fun playing a 7 player draft! It takes a long time but is certainly a great experience. I'm really enjoying getting back into a bit of Magic. If you treat the tournament as one long game, the mana screw problem seems like just part of the game.\n\nUpdate 2025: I've been playing commander for the past 3 years and it's the most fun I've had playing magic. Building decks is super fun, so much variety in board states.",

The current \"Beginner Box\" is excellent and offers similar opportunities.\n\nDrafting is one of the best formats to play once you are familiar with the game, and you can make your own draft set with a playset of commons and uncommons (I had draft pools for 9E, TSP, and LRW blocks).\n\nElder Dragon Highlander is also a fun format (e.g. a RG Beast deck, and a UW flying deck), and can be particularly enjoyable in a 2 Headed Giant Format where you have partners playing each other.\n\nPlaying on Magic the Gathering Online enables playing with people around the world at any time of the day, and the Momir BASIC avatar gives you access to a casual format using every card in the game.",

    "comment": "Magic: The Gathering is one of the greatest games of all time. The mana system creates the foundation of one of the greatest deckbuilding puzzles. The variety of cards that exist is staggering. The designers of cards are some of the best. Although it is a card game, the skill ceiling in this game is maybe not as high as chess, but is higher than something like poker. It is a game that allows for perfect skill and personal expression each time you sit down to play, regardless of what level you play at.\n\nAt the same time, know that if you get into magic, you are signing up for a lifestyle game. People don't really play magic AND other board games. You have magic players, and you have board game players, and it's more rare to have those two groups intersect than you might think. I have played Magic off and on from when I was 13 or so until I was 28. I have many lifelong friends and memories because of this game.\n\nMagic is also the most expensive of hobbies. You can, if you are budget conscious, buy prebuilt commander decks and play with friends, but know that you are potentially getting into far more if you have self-control issues. Unlike with board games where there is a hard upper limit on how many nice components you can buy to improve a board game, there exists no such upper limit for how nice of MTG cards you could buy to make your deck either look better or play better, depending on whether you are playing competitively or not. Even just drafting every once in a while can be expensive.\n\nI will likely not ever play magic again. At the same time, I have far too many good memories with the game to not give it a 10. It has shaped far too much of my life, which no other game other than Agricola has done for me.",

    "comment": "3/18/25: I've backed off from MTG being my favorite game period, but it's still a 10 and an all-time favorite.\n\nOne of the things that makes CCGs and their ilk somewhat fragile, at least for me, is the need for a community -- a place to play and people to play with, either on a regularly scheduled basis or because when you go there MTG players are almost always around. I had the latter in college, and the former until late 2024 when scheduling conflicts (and other real-life stuff) made it increasingly challenging to attend EDH nights at my local shops.\n\nI still play with a pod of friends, but we only play once or twice a month and only at lower power levels. I've sold most of my cards because they're just not needed in that environment.\n\nMTG nudged miniatures games out of my gaming diet in part because it requires a much lower investment of time and energy to produce an equally enjoyable payoff (play). In 2025, even when I could attend an LGS EDH night, I'd rather schedule a wargame match. It's cheaper than keeping up with MTG, the scheduling is more flexible, and the payoff in fun is equally good.\n\nMy 6-12 months of intense EDH play from 2023-2024 were a blast. MTG has now settled back down to the level of other board/card games in my life, just one option among many. I'm OK with that.\n---\n2/3/24: My overall favorite game at present. Coming back to MTG and getting into Commander was one of the best gaming decisions I've ever made.\n\nToday I played my 100th logged game since I got back into MTG (mid-2023) and since I started logging plays (2008), a delightful Jumpstart 2022 match against a friend I made playing Magic.\n---\n8/22/23: Yeah, this is a 10. It's one of a handful of games I've found compelling for most of my life (and I found it so from afar while not playing it).\n\nThe design space when building a deck, the play space at the table, and the interaction between those two are just fantastic. It's rich and complex while still being approachable, and it really fires up my brain.\n---\n8/21/23: In what's probably the greatest redemption arc of any game I've played, re-rated from a 2 to a 9. I got back into MTG after a 26-year hiatus. It's grand.\n\nStill expensive, and still driven by blind buys? Sure. But the infrastructure underpinning the secondary market is vast and efficient now, you can goldfish decks online, and there are multiple stores in Seattle hosting a myriad of MTG nights across many modes of play.\n\nComing back to MTG in my 40s was a great decision. Commander is a ton of fun.\n---\nI stopped playing M:TG years ago; if I still played, it'd likely be a 9. It's a beautiful thing from a design standpoint, and I absolutely loved deck construction and the tension of competitive play (especially in a tournament environment), but the expansion grind and the time and money commitment involved to stay competitive was just insane.\n\nI still remember individual turns from tournament games I played back in the late '90s -- especially the ones where I had a really good deck, understood the metagame of the moment, and could play like hell. If I had a zillion dollars, could count on a local community of competitive players, and had the time to keep up with the game, I'd start playing Magic again in a heartbeat.\n\nRating as a game on its own merits: 8. Rating because it's a collectible game and I want nothing to do with CCGs (etc.) anymore: 2.",

So many great memories including multiple huge tournaments in Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Albuquerque. As of December 2024, I have played and rated 300 games (I plan did not update my rankings in 2023, and I am only ranking the top 100 of these 300 games at the end of 2024). I have been good about maintaining it (proof that I am truly a boardgamegeek). I manage my top games list as follows: Top 10 = 10, 11-30 = 9.5, 31-50 = 9, 51-70 = 8.5, 71-100 = 8, 100-150 = 7.5, 151-200 = 7, 201-230 = 6.5, and 231+ 6 and lower. If you sort by \"Your Rating\" you should see my ranking for the top 100. One note, I don't plan to rank expansions separate from the base game. I will consider whether BGG rates certain games separately, but will make my own judgement call. A final note on my list. My rankings reflect my own experience with games, which is why my top 3 will likely never change. My rankings do not necessarily mean my favorite game at a given point in time as much as my all time favorite games. The number in brackets represent my rankings at the end of 2022 (193 games). I did not update rankings for 2023. I played 52 new to me games 2023. My goal was to average one new game per week in 2022, and I was able to meet my goal. For my end of 2024 rankings, I have updated the ranking in brackets and also add parenthesis showing the previous 2022 ranking or (*) if new to me in 2023 OR 2024 and not ranked in 2022. I played 55 new to me games in 2024, so for the 3rd straight year in retirement, I have met my goal of at least one new to me game per week.

Would like to try building a cube one day.\n\nAfter playing Magic on and off (mostly off) since Revised in 1993, to me the game has never been better than it has been for the past couple of years. I got back into it after a 15-year hiatus, which was only preceded by a short period of play after another long hiatus.\n\nThe set and card designs are more interesting and balanced than in the 90s and 00s, and the variety of game formats one can play, really make this a rich experience.\n\nFinally, throw in the fact that going to prerelease events is consistently among my favorite gaming experiences makes Magic my current #1 “board game” of all time.\n\nBeware of course the predatory FOMO marketing practices and temptation to overspend. But there really is no need to go over the top financially; again, there are so many ways to play and probably my favorite (sealed) is the least expensive dollar-wise.",

    "comment": "Man, I played the heck out of this game. I got into Magic when the arabian knights were still out for purchase. This was just an incredible game at the time. Of course, over the years it just became so flooded with cards it is not even worth it anymore. I still play occassionaly with family or even online, which I do like, but I just can't keep up with the realm anymore. I played this game most likely thousands of times. (I even won a couple of sit down tournaments when the \"legends\" series came out.)",

Semplice, intuitivo ma con una profondità di gioco e una strategia ancora invidiata da tanti successori. Conosco poco le ultime espansioni uscite ma ci gioco di tanto in tanto su tabletop simulator con amici ex giocatori. Limiti? Le troppe espansioni acchiappa soldi.",

SOMETHING. HAS. SERIOUSLY. BEEN. LOST.\n\nCounterfeiters will inevitably perfect their technique, forcing Wizards of the Coast to abandon their Reserve List policy once Power Nine, Workshops, Drains, and Duals flood the market. I personally can't wait. M:TG is my favorite game that many people will never experience at it's highest levels because it's locked behind an arbitrary paywall so that the company that produces it can exploit human psychology to make more money.\n\nIt requires strategy, tactics, and skill. All while simultaneously being a conflict, puzzle, and a race, and is successful in each of those aspects. The most innovative game of its era that spawned a bunch of mediocre knockoffs and inspired designers for generations to come. One of the few games that can also be an investment.\n\nFFGs Living Card Game model fixes the uneven playing field inherent in a random distribution model, and all but eliminates the secondary market, which is positive or negative depending on your perspective. After 14 years of placing highly in a lot of little suburban tournaments and shrewdly trading away my Timmy/Johhny cards for Spike cards, I sold my collection... and all I got was a lousy nest egg and a down payment on a house.\n\nI played, on average, at least once a day for 14 years, and still occasionally play here and there, giving me an average of over 5000 days of playtime. Each year, more and more mediocre board games get published, and I still want to play MTG, but The only way I play anymore is with my proxied cube and proxied commander decks\n\nMy rating is biased due to nostalgia, but despite the game's Skinnerian distribution model, it is technically still a game, and if you rate it a 1, we can't be friends.\n\n\nThough, I enjoy playing MLD, Hatebears, and Stax decks simply for the schadenfreude, so perhaps I'm Dimir(UB) or Sultai(BUG)\n\nTop 8 Favorite Alpha/Beta/Unlimited cards other than the obvious degenerate restricted cards\n\n1 Counterspell\n2 Sinkhole\n3 Hypnotic Specter\n4 Stasis\n5 Icy Manipulator\n6 Armageddon\n7 Control Magic\n8 Winter Orb",
