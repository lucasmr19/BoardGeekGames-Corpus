    "comment": "Far too much Analysis Paralysis during both games. This game isn't sufficiently interesting to justify waiting ten minutes between turns with six players, just to play a card I've already decided on and say \"Next\". Yes, it's more strategic than 6 Nimmt. But the delays kill the push your luck excitement of its predecessor game.\n\n4/10. And I went to buy 6 Nimmt today, the game I enjoy: 8/10.",
