He uses the money to develop and buy nukes. The other players try to boost price of goods by buying stuff; Player A then sells his own supplies of the same stuff, wrecking the market again, uses money to buy nukes. This goes on until Player A is forced by rock-bottom market prices to buy his nukes by going deep into debt. When he can't go any more in debt, he launches his nukes, eventually causing so much damage that the world is destroyed by nuclear winter. Game over.",

We found early on how to manipulate the market and take out gigantic loans and destroy the world. The million expansions each with only a few pages of rules each is an early example of milking people by not giving them enough content. Particularly bad was the wording of the rules... too much for how simple the game actually was... too simple actually. Not having enough small bills was also an idiotically annoying thing with the game. However, the art and production value of the game was outstanding for the time period. The mechanics of this game could not stand the test of time then, and certainly do not stand up to people's current expectations. It is possible to house-rule it, primarily with the Neo-Supremacy rules on the Internet, but the only reason to bother would be for the sake of the theme. All of that being said, I would be interested in the game IF it were done by a famous designer such as the ones who publish games through GMT and Compass to a lesser extent.",

I cannot see myself ever wanting to play the base game again as the Mega Map and many of the expansions make the game far more interesting, and complex.",

Fortunately, that was the only time we ever had nuclear winter.\n\nI still remember one game when we played with only one L star card in the resource deck and 3 nukes. Everyone had nukes, but L stars were rare. We all had about 3 nukes just to play the MAD game. Suddenly, I farmed a L star out of the resource deck, but I didn't have the money to build and cover my expenses next turn. My buddies mood went bleak as I was envisioning extorting them every turn for money to fund my new L star deployment program. (yes, I am evil, eeeevil)\n\nMy buddy Jason pulled off the greatest play I think I ever saw in the game. He nuked my entire mineral production. No L star for me, no matter how much money I had. And I had just spent all my savings mining the resource deck for the L star. I could not afford mine for mineral. God bless Jason where ever he is.\n\nThis game is LOADS OF FUN and will create memories. The only reason I only gave it a 7 instead of 9/10 is it takes time. I mean TIME. Expect to start around noon, and play the game until its time to hit the bar, if you decide to hit the bar. Many times we played on.\n\nI say it takes time, but we had all the expansions: tanks, subs, spies, unconventional forces, neutron bombs, pirates, warlords, fortuna and high tech. We even used the 5x8 huge map, which my friend had laminated.\n\nThe basic game is easy to learn and can maybe take a couple of hours depending on how you play. Each round has 2 things everyone does, and you have to choose 3 out of the next six things you can do. More forces gets a die advantage, as well as having more l stars. Its simple math, even I understood it.\n\nI highly recommend everyone to at least give the basic game a try.",

Picture yourself as the leader of a super power, The Economics of your country is your responsablity, Your countries research and development is also in your hands. Peace and war is made by split second thinking and the need to secure resources. Be carefull because what starts out to be a simple war can explode and become a world war with Nuclure weapons being fired to a certain Apoclyptic Doom.",
