    "comment": "This is a filler game with some simple strategic elements. The character art on the cards is nice. Draw 0 or 2 cards on your turn. Then score your face up pile if possible and you desire. Next play matching colored cards into the face down or face up stacks. Finally pass your cards to the right, but play proceeds to the left. Only score if you have the same number of cards that match a number on one of the cards in the pile. There is strategy in keeping your scoring stack playable, but it can get annoying if you are not getting the cards you need. Also not knowing the other player's face down stacks adds to the unpredictability. More players add to the challenge.",

On the other hand, not having a set hand order is fantastic, and the way that fields score is actually pretty clever. I am much more willing to play this sequel than the original game, although I'm still not wild about Uwe Rosenberg games in general.",
