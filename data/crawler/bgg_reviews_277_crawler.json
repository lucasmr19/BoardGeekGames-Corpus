I don't think we made the most advantage of the communication possibilities in the trade offers (I certainly didn't) but it was quite enjoyable.",

    "comment": "This game, a find in a used bookstore, proved to be far more entertaining than what I anticipated. Maybe it just works really well with my family.\n\nHere's what's special about it: you don't just trade cards in the game, you also trade information about what you're trying to do. In Bohnanza, players cycle through their cards too quickly and build their bean-fields in the open, making the information about their hands very cheap. In Res Publica, sets take a lot longer to acquire while hidden from view, and players have much more control over what they reveal. I'm not aware of any other game where trading and hidden information are balanced quite like this.\n\nQueen Games made a couple of strange changes to the deck and rules: there are only 5 cards of monks and books (instead of Knizia's design for 6 of each), and only 2 monk/book cards are need to make a set for the special bonuses (instead of 3). This obviously leaves the odd 5th card as useless and unbalances the game toward players lucky enough to draw 2 monk cards). I'm adopting the suggested houserule to require 3 cards for these sets, and shuffle a card from a completed monk/book set into the deck. See this thread: On the 2011 Queen Version",

    "comment": "A remarkably clever trading game where you may only make one offer/counter-offer for every deal on the table. Deals are made over sets of cards, sets are traded in for settlements, which give you more cards and eventually cities. A game where you must listen carefully, and carefully consider your limited chances to trade. A delight to play a trade/negotiation game where you don't have to shout to get anywhere!",
