I'm not quite on board with the philosophy that games don't need engaging bits, so the components are adrawback, and the game isn't deep enough to hold me, but it's alright.",

Audrey won the top two spots, and the death of Oskarâ€™s last sous chef doomed him to second and me a distant third at best. Brainless game, but does not overstay, and it has a humerous theme.\n\n8/24: A fun round with Audrey wiping us out, Stefan second and me a distant third, although we all got three up.",
