    "comment": "I can see how this is the precursor to a lot of trading euro games, except this was immediately so funny and the theme came to life. I want to trade with the charts, but they demand certain exchanges, and it's hard to get precise deals. And then the shifting goal cards means certain colors become valuable or worthless instantly. Best of all, on other players' turns you can think about the complicated exchange chart, so there's something to do! And when you realize someone's going for the same card you are, it becomes like Can't Stop to see who's luckier and scores it first.\n\nAll I can think of his how this is still better than 99% of modern euros, more depth while also being way easier to learn. Or maybe that's a sign of modern euros being bloated, they're ridiculously complex to get started, while demanding the tiniest amount of brainpower.",
