The game can also be cruel, I've seen people with a stretch of bad luck be completely wiped out the game and effectively be just moving from square to square for the sake of it. I detest any game where a run of bad luck can rule you out a game which will last another two hours!",

    "comment": "\"Monopoly with a liquidity crisis.\" This game is tedious and takes FOREVER to play because nobody ever has enough money to buy shares [the game can't end until all the shares are bought]. The \"show on the road\" segment constantly sends you backward, takes your money, etc. and is frustrating beyond words. Pro tip: play time can be shortened substantially by giving all players more money to start.",

    "comment": "Great premise, but unfortunately the game does not work well. After a luck-ridden opening and on the road outer track for productions, a money crunch occurs in midgame. As this eases later in the game, the rich tend to get richer much faster. Game's end is often a foregone conclusion, though the Tony Awards can create a lucky bonus in an interesting mechanism as shows are eliminated and players have to decide which shows to commit their resources to go all the way. Home rule tweakers may be able to make this playable, perhaps just by increasing the money in the game at startup, but not enough interesting decisions here to make the playtesting investment worthwhile.",
