Mechanically it's mostly just Gin Rummy, but with letters or letter strings forming words instead of playing cards forming hands. Words start small in the first round (three cards), and increase each round up to ten cards at the end of the game. There are some fun bonuses (most words in a round, longest word in a round) that might convince you to hold out for just the right letter to get you to longest word, which can be fun. You also can't end the round unless you are using all of your cards, which forces people to figure out how to use them all as fast as possible. These different factors pull you in multiple directions, making for an entertaining game.\n\nThe cards look great as well. The letters have a fun style to them.\n[card game - rummy]",

Still, the game is accessible to even the youngest of players able to read and parse letters into words; making it an all-ages kitchen table game for you and your friends.\n\nAn excellent alternative way to play a word spelling game; and my favorite one of its kind.",

I'd like to learn new words, rather than just be tested on ones I already know.\n\nHere's my idea for a variant: At the beginning of the game, each player chooses a set number of unfamiliar words from the dictionary (suggest between 3-5). If that player successfully plays one of their words during a round, they receive 10 bonus points.",

It's breezy fun for word nerds! The solo mode is also fantastic-- like patience solitaire but with letters.\n\n6/2021- Even though my mom usually beats me, I enjoy a good game of Quiddler. The tension ratchets up the larger your hand of cards gets, and it's always nail-biting to see who will go out first!",

Sometimes you just don't get the cards though and that is fine. My only downside is my family fights a lot on what words are \"legal\" playing words",
