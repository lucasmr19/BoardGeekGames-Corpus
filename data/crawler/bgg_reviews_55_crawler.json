Like a trivial pursuit in which all the questions are about philosophy and are either completely banal or completely unsolvable.\nTakes far too long, is ugly as hell and falls into the same category as Monopoly or Trivial Pursuit, where after 2.5 hours all players just want this boring ordeal to end - but it stretches on for the next 1.5 hours. Only this time with Habermas and Wittgenstein.",

    "comment": "Trivial pursuit, but then aimed at philosophical/religious issues during 6 bygone periods: Mythical Age, Hellenism/Rome, Medieval Period, Rennaissance/Baroc, The Enlightment and 19/20th Century.\n\nEven though it has some weird rules about moving and poorly written rules, they are only 2 pages so it's a minor complaint. Wouldn't play it everyday, but it's actually quite entertaining to bring to the table for the right crowd, when in the right mood.\n\nDiscovered I suck at Philosophic reasoning, too. For me, a question is something to be answered, not to be pondered over from viewpoint to viewpoint. Yes, this might learn any bystanders about how issues can be viewed from multiple sides, plus you can show off how 'smart' you are (seem). But for me, another viewpoint is only to be explored if the first doesn't solve the problem. Ah well, maybe age will bring what I need",
