The neutral orcs, dragon, and peacekeeper sorcerer, as well as your own warrior and wizard, had twists to the game. It definitely shows it's age today with lengthy setup, imbalanced chance cards, and swingy combat dice mechanics. However, Wizard's Quest has its charm.",

    "comment": "This one will be my go to bridgehead strategy game for new and casual boardgame players (who previously got burnt by RISK).\n\nPlayers acts as warlords competing for the title of \"King\" by sending their warbands out on the hunt for their own hidden 3 insignias of power.\n\nComplicating the players quests are aggressive and very reproductive hordes of Orks, a land roaming wizard (who pacifies his host province and gives out boni and mali to players) and a restless dragon that likes to eat orks and men alike), all of which are controlled by a rudimentary, but tightly written behavioural algorithm.\n\nThe player, who obtained his or her 3 insignias of power before the other players, wins the ceremonial title of \"King (or Queen) of Marnon\" and hence the game.\n\nI buffed up the visual and haptic experience with lots of wooden meeples and tokens, making it much more appealing than the games original cardboard chits were.\n\nSince the German version has only a \"Petition Pool\" with 10 boni for each player to choose from, I decided to upgrade my German version of the game (MARNON) by translating and redesigning the original PETITION-card-deck and having it printed into a customized playing card deck, to be able to add this to the game, if there'd be a need to separate the rules into a \"Core\" and \"Advanced play\" version.\n\nNow - with its latest rules compilation added to it - it got all the goodies of its original english version, with the much more appealing haptic and visual feel of the new millenium.\n\nAnd still it is a good, engaging, thematicly sound, fun and classic family strategy game for the ages.",

    "comment": "I recall playing this with my friends as a teen and had a chance to break it out about a year ago. Still love it!! We had a great time and played it quite a bit. It needs 4 or more players to get the most out of it. Randomness is certainly a factor but does not drive the game. Bad things happen when bad dice are rolled. I am not afraid of dice: I am not a wine snob, I'm not a hops snob, and I aint no dice snob! Bring on the raucous randomness! Dice rolling leads to lots of anticipation and strategy busting/booming. When the dragon attacks or orcs frenzy you or the enemy. This is a one of AH's more playable games for those who are not into full-on strategy games. Its a great mix up and these days I dare say a nice intro into the retro realm of little cardboard squares. It does take a long time to play so sit back and watch your opponents groan and grimace during Orc Frenzy phase.",
