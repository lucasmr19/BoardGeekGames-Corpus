Even the worst dungeon crawl game you can think of is a work of genius compared to this mess. No one wins. No player interaction and do decisions to be made. Simply awful. UPDATE. Watched the new FFG version being played at Gencon and I had forgotten DQ's biggest sin: it is slow as hell. God watching this was a bore. Anything this utterly random and punishing should be brisk and not the tedious, cumbersome, and plodding chore it is.",

That is, assuming that your path (which you pick up randomly) doesn't lead you astray... and assuming that you actually survive the dragon, who can simply roast you if you pick (randomly) the wrong tile. And assuming that you are still alive all the nasty (random) encounters and survive the (/rock-paper-scissors) combat.\nSo basically there is nothing to winning this game except being extremely lucky. Takes about 45 minutes to play. Why not just roll a die and get it over with?",

Would greed prevail and kill him?\n\nAll while facing the dreadful time counter running down the timer and a sudden death when too slow to flee the castle!\n\nDungeon Quest is easy to access, tense, immersive and fun.
