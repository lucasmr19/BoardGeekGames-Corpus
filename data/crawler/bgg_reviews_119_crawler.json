    "comment": "A decent game, reminds me a lot of Knizia's Gold Rush, just more control. Not sure if that's a good thing though. It's a similar choice of declaring your scoring too early or too late, but it's way more complex with adding rows and columns, so even if one sum sucks you could get paid by the other. The negative points are very funny, but soon that laughter fades away to pure logic as you count up the totals. And multiply them! It feels like the opposite of some of Knizia's games where the player-driven situation turns out to be funny, but here it's merely the presence of negative VPs which gets old super fast.\n\nThat's not entirely a bad thing, but less exciting (more euro) than the pure speculation of Gold Rush. And the payouts don't divide in this game, so it's much less dramatic, more static, more friendly. I guess this one is more controlled, you can choose exactly when you want to score, gotta make sure the left-hand opponent doesn't take advantage of that... but I liked the uncertainty of the older game more. So this one is a stiff VP salad, but I can (barely) appreciate it because it allows players to actually be mean to each other. As long as they don't have too much fun, there's calculations waiting at home!",

The new Avalon Hill edition is fantastic and makes this game a pleasure to handle. I would have loved slightly thicker tiles and point tokens but I am quite happy that this game has now a cool psychedelic theme. Keeper.",

May be surpassing Battle Line as my all time fav Knizia. So, so good for new board gamers. I've not had this one not hit. Tense, mean, brutal, wonderful...[SF]",
