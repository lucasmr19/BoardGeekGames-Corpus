This may have been \"fun\" in the Tactics II era (i.e. pre-color-TV), but... Gimme a break. The only people that might possibly buy this one are folks that have the locations and routes totally memorized (you know who you are), and have a hankering for some major nostalgia.

    "comment": "I'll lead with my bias: I'm not a huge fan of pick-up-and-deliver (PUAD). I find it tedious as a mechanic and most missteps result in back-tracking (the antithesis of fun). That said, I do kind of like route-building and I always appreciate a good train game.\n\nLet's assume that the PUAD portion is at least average by other people's standards, even though to me it's tiresome. The problem with Empire Builder is the other component building blocks are all below average in their respective categories:\n\n-The engine-buidling is really minimal relative to the scale of the game (the slope is not very steep and not very long)\n-The economic component is flat and disinteresting without space for creative play\n-The game is devoid of any real shared incentives with minimal player interaction (perhaps this is wanting it to be a stock game when it's not, maybe not a fair criticism)\n\nI had many turns go by where I was just moving my piece the maximum distance and then passing. Not many fun things to think about or plan between turns to keep your mind engaged. You make a mental order of operations that is the most efficient combination of options available and you execute. *shrug*\n\nI will say the route-building is pretty fun. And writing on the map is just money. There should be more crayons in games. I also appreciate that this game was a step in a new direction for train games, and honestly the rough outline of what would one day be Union Pacific/Ticket to Ride to me seems evident. I would much rather play TTR than EB. It's faster, the decision space is tighter and more interesting, the game arc has a steeper slope while also achieving a greater dynamic range, and it strips away pieces parts that are ok to let go.\n\nGiven that 1830 was more or less a contemporary, I can't give this one much leeway I'll often afford to older technology. I'm just not excited to play it again. But I guess I would if you love it and want me to.",

The simulation aspect of \"how do rail lines evolve, when do you lease vs buy, etc\" is really fascinating and almost overwhelming for novice players. Unfortunately, this falls flat and shows it's age; the event cards are straight 80s dickage, and the cards in general are difficult to get a solid handle on. Last, so many turns were spent just moving the 12 spaces and waiting. In that regard, it reminds me of High Frontier in so far as you make estimates based on factors that are sort of in your control, but you won't have a solid grasp on the commitment (of rail lines, and early goods/cash), and the second half (or two thirds) of the game is seeing if that commitment pays off. For that reason, I could see the short variant being a serious improvement, but it's just a product of it's age I guess...",

The rules are relatively simple, and everyone is participating over a shared board and space.\n\nHowever, the parts I don't like include some lengthy downtime as others carefully plan out turns. It doesn't help that you often deliver and then pull some random events and contracts and then have to figure out right then what you're doing which means it's tough to plan ahead to make the turn go faster.\n\nIt's also just a tad on the fiddly end for me with players having to do lots of simple counting and changing of money in order to properly execute the game state. I don't think there's a clear way around it, and the game is interesting in the way it is, but overall there's just a tad too much time being spent on things other than interesting game decisions for this title to be great.",

Ticket to Ride or Trans America is better for casual gamers, while hardcore gamers would want literally anything else.\n\nThe remake putting maps on the cards will probably shave off a good 30 minutes, even veterans have to examine where everything is. I'm surprised they never did this before.",

We prefer these with 2, as we can play them faster. Never quite the same game twice with the different resources and routes the change with the dealt cards. Definitely some luck involved, but generally good strategy wins out most of the time.",

It's a great game for any age capable of counting to twenty.\nAmongst professional train gamers it is a 90-minute game, with a mix of accounting, intrigue, luck, and comradery.",
