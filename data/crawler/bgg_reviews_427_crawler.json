I'd trash this game in no time if it were not for the fact that my girlfriend actually likes it (as incredible as it might sound!). Surely the designers were smoking really bad stuff when then created this nonsense.",

There are 20-25 different cards in the game, none of which has any kind of rules printed on them: you have to either memorize everything or always look them up in the rules (stoned people play this game?? HOW???). This is the only complication to what is otherwise a very simple take-that card game. Game would get a 2, but not printing any text at all on any card makes it deserving of a '1'.",

Don't get me wrong-it went on too long, the luck to strategy balance is way out of whack and the rule set is crap, but what made it rise a degree above Uno was an element of negotiation- which turned out to be quite fun with those who were at the table- ex weed-heads, the lot of them!",
