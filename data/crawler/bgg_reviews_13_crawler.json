    "comment": "Worst game ever. Never play orange and use the beginning setup. That is if you can distinguish orange from red. The horrendous orange and red colours are almost identical. I would say that I wasted 1½ hours of my life trying to play this game, but at least I now know that this game is extremely bad and never to play it again. Why didn't you build a road they said. A bit difficult when you don't have the resources. Oh wait I now have the resources, but the player before has just built a road where I was going to go. Build a settlement. Nope, not enough resources. Ok, let's get resources. Ah but you have to be adjacent to the relevant hex to get them. Nope again. Everyone else is next to them, but you are not. This resulted in more than a dozen dice rolls where the rest of the players gleefully acquired resources and I sat there twiddling my thumbs. When I finally acquired the resources for a settlement, yes you've guessed it, another player built a settlement before I could. The robber. Why? Activated on a dice roll of 7. Why? Too many knights were drawn, and why do they have to take a card from you? Absolute garbage of a game. No wonder it needs so many expansions to try and make it a game. Avoid at all costs as I will in the future.",

    "comment": "Most Over-Hyped BoardGame of the Modern BoardGame Era .. Please Avoid & Don't Use as an Intro Game\n\n○ Short Why This Review :\n\nI want more people to like board gaming... this bad game turns people off board gaming.\n\nRun, .. run very fast... don't say you weren't warned.\n\n○ Short Synopsis :\n\nWay, way, way too much luck for such a long, laborious, & way overpriced game (for $68+ w expansion, you can get one or more games that are way, way, way more fun.)\n\n○ Why This Review :\n\nPre-pandemic, I ran the largest irl board gaming group in NJ... I think board games are a healthy way to have fun & socialize, and I would love for board gaming to become even more popular.\n\nCatan is a dated game, that easily turns meeples off gaming; and should 'never' be used as an intro to board gaming game. But even if you're not new to gaming, you shouldn't waste your time & money on this game.\n\n○ Synopsis :\n\nCatan pretty much fails at every level, & only excels in two categories:\n\n• Schadenfreude\n• Masochism\n\n○ Detailed Review:\n\nSo let's take a tour of all the failures :\n\n#1 Failure :-)) Way, way, way too much luck for the length of the game!\n\nGames with a heavy luck component aren't inherently bad \"per se\"... to each their own, no?\n\nBut, \"in general\", games with heavy luck are shorter, games with less luck are longer. This also tends to mirror the goals of the game for the different player demographics. Short/lucky/light gamers aren't looking for complex rules and/or playing experiences .. they want a light fun experience (usu while waiting for another game and/or while doing something else.) Conversely, long/strategic/heavy gamers are usually looking for minimal luck, because they want their decisions to matter & they want their investment in time to be worth it.\n\nCatan is broken no matter which way you look at it... it's a luck game that's too long, or it's a strategy game with too much luck. There's luck in the dice rolling for resources, there's luck in which development cards you draw (no choice), and if all the players are equal level - good luck with the completely broken trading mechanism. Have a great strategy?.. managed to get lumber & brick on an 8!.. ? ... watch the Schadenfreude of the other players as 8 fails to get rolled during the course of a game! ? ... so, not only are you having a miserable time, but because these critical resources are now constrained, watch as the whole game slows to a crawl & trading becomes non-existent.\n\n#2 Failure :-)) No catch-up mechanism...\n\nSo after 30 min, you realize you've 60 min to go & no chance of winning... does this sound like fun to you?.. if yes, well I did say this game excelled in Masochism .. if not, well, there's probably another person turned off board gaming ?\n\nI'm not saying that every game needs to have a catch-up mechanism, nor am I saying that every game which does, does it well. The closest Catan has, is the trading mechanism... but that's not a good catchup mechanism, as it only works with equally talented & advanced gamers that can see the weighted value of a trade .. (and of course, even if they do weight it correctly luck can completely upend any careful planning). Plus, the more restricted trading is, the slower the game; which if you're not in a position where you can actually win, just makes the game more painful.\n\n#3 Failure :-)) Various mechanics \"were\" cutting edge...\n\nYou might think this is a positive, and if you traveled back in time, it was. But another way to think of it, in today's terms; many of the mechanics were an \"early alpha\" release. And many, many games have taken the mechanics in Catan and tweaked/evolved/re-combined them to make much, much better games.\n\n#4 Failure :-)) Some mechanics don't really work...\n\nThe trading is the biggest failure in Catan... there's no real structure given to it, & the resources are so scarce it makes trading painful at best. What success there can be, is completely up to the player \"group\", and not wrt the game. And in a cutthroat game, of equal level players, trading often falls apart completely contributing to the length of the game.\n\nThe board layout (when done randomly) is often unbalanced ... you can often determine \"who's in the running\" & who's not simply by this alone. So imagine playing a 90 minute game, & having almost no chance to win due to skill, right from the start!.. I've seen a player there, & they were so frustrated, I never saw them board game again.\n\nThe \"robber\" makes a bad game worse by having the players attack one another... and most games aren't fun with this aspect as an aside, unless the act of attacking other players is directly designed to be fun (The Dragon & Flagon) comes to mind. And since the robber is on a 7, it's the most frequent action.\n\n## History :-)) Ok, here's where Catan has value.\n\nDo you like to goto Museums?.. Do you like to use old 8-bit tech, to relive the \"Glory Days\" of your youth?.. Ok then there's no doubt Catan, like the Neanderthal or the Dodo, have a place in history. One could argue, it was the 'first' mainstream euro board game to reach zeitgeist in pop culture.\n\nSo while it deserves a place in history, as does Monopoly & it's 275 million copies (as of 2015), that doesn't make it a good game worth playing in modern times.\n\n## Honorable Mention :-)) But what about the expansions?...\n\nOne of the common refrains I hear from meeples who've drank the Catan Kool-Aid is that, \"ok, granted there are some aspects of the game that aren't that great; but the expansions help.\"\n\nFirst, I really dislike a game where it 'requires' an expansion... when that's the case, the base game should just include the expansion. Secondly, you're throwing more money after bad; Catan is already overpriced (MSRP: $55.00, but usu seasonally averaging $32 or $46) plus then either of the two commonly recommended/overpriced expansions of Cities & Knights (MSRP: $55.00, but usu seasonally averaging $37 or $43) or Seafarers Expansion (MSRP: $55.00, but usu seasonally averaging $36 or $44). To them, I challenge, you're telling me that for $68+ the 'best' you can do for gaming value is Catan + Expansion?.?..\n\nAlso I will note that even the most fervent Catan cultist when giving the above defense, will say \"help\" & not \"fix\"... so in the end, you're looking at $68+ for a \"meh\" ? game.\n\n** $68+ :-)) Hmmm...\n\nThis is off the top of my head...\n\nTransAmerica $33\nArmadora $20\nLove Letter $9\nSushi Go! $6\n\n... not a definitive, list, just top of the head stuff / first thing to pop in my mind... but way more fun, & all of which are better for beginners.\n\n** Only saving grace :-)) It comes with two dice...\n\nHere's my recommendation, take the two dice, & everyone rolls off... highest total wins. In case of tie, all repeat the roll (go catchup mech!) until only one player has the highest total. Then make a cool game with the components, and/or use the components to replace missing pieces from other games.\n\nWas it fun?.. I don't know, but at least you saved 89 minutes of your life for a game, after which you'll ask yourself, \"was it fun\", and probably still have the same average answer of \"meh\" ?.\n\nI'll end with a favorite quote of mine...\n\n“A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.” -- Joshua/WOPR -- WarGames (1983)",

This has been a staple gateway game for many starting to get into the board game community. It seems to me there are a million games in existence now that have taken any positive traits from this game and improved upon them. The game mechanics of this game seem very outdated and poor.\n\nThe thing that bugs me the most about this game is how reliant it is on luck and initial placement. Better games allow the user to do something to better their position every turn regardless of how bad that person is at the game or how far that individual is behind. For this game, you can easily waste countless turns waiting for the dice to roll in your favor. My first time playing it, I spent half the game unable to do anything due to bad rolls. For me, this game is very boring and very frustrating, with the potential to go way too long. What's even worse, is this game has the potential to prevent newcomers to the community from giving better designed games a chance. Had this been more widely adopted, I think this game deserves more of a negative stigma than Monopoly or Candy Land since the actual player involvement has the capability to be so low with bad rolls.",

The only reason I would play this is if my friends don't want to do or play anything else, and then it is purely for their company, with no real engagement with the game on my part.\n\nI know its supposed to be excused for its bad mechanics and little depth because it is a gateway game, but I can name so many games that can show people what games are really capable of with just as little complexity. Even party games would do a far better job than this.",

Now, a year or so after adopting the hobby, I've had a chance to try it, the patient zero of euro games' western journey, and... It turns out my gut was right. \"Patient Zero\" turns out to be an apt metaphor, as this game needs to be quarantined and carefully examined, so we can all see exactly what's wrong with it and never, ever again make those mistakes.\nCatan is unbelievably frustrating, boring, and random. The complete incompetence in which each of its mechanics are implemented is nothing short of incredible. Rolling for resources is okay in a lighter game like Machi Koro, but Catan wants to be a Game For Big Boys(tm) with its modular board and hex tiles and wooden houses and 2-hour play time that feels like 8. Open resource trading is okay in... Well, nothing I've ever played, but it's at its worst and most painfully pointless in Catan. Take-that mechanics are okay in plenty of games, but in Catan you don't want to use them because your fellow players are already suffering enough. A friendly game of Catan is mechanically equivalent to a group of starving POWs playing Craps for their last few pieces of moldy gruel for the week occasionally giving each other unprompted cigarette burns while listening to their captors having a rollicking good time eating steaks and playing King of Tokyo or something on the other side of the cell door. Maybe one of them steps in from time to time and gleefully pistol-whips somebody.\nSome say Catan deserves respect for its role in paving the way for better games, but I say the benefit of experiencing time in a linear fashion is that we now have access to all those better games, and your copy of Catan can be safely discarded in whatever manner you choose without any fear of games like Space Base getting sucked out of existence via time paradox.\nSo yes, Catan is bad. Some of the awfulness can be alleviated by house rules, variants, or maybe expansions, so I won't give it a 1, but wouldn't it be easier to just play something else?\nConclusion: 2/10, At least it's better than Munchkin.",

There is a skill plateau that anyone can reach within a handful of sessions.

    "comment": "This was my second ‘genuine’ boardgame I ever played (after Avalon Hill’s Civilization), and the experience was not pleasant. I played with 3 players, and we were soon leafing through the rules to establish whether we’d done anything wrong. We were rolling dice and growing, but there wasn't any sense of progression or challenge. I then played a few games with 4 players, and became intimately familiar with the rather annoying phenomenon of getting no useful resources for a long period of time simply because the dice (of course) didn’t land on their expected values. The standard reply is that you need to trade to alleviate this problem, and that the leaders should be excluded from trade. And that brings me to the heart of the issue I have with Settlers. It's not really the fact that 2D6 determine which resources get produced; no, it's that the game relies on people actively recognising that someone is doing too well, and then simply excluding him from participation in the game to a considerable extent until they catch up. I want to feel engaged, not given the proverbial cold shoulder until the rest have decided that it's okay to play with me again.\n\nA second though lesser issue I have is that the game also doesn’t give you a meaningful choice what to with the dice as in, for example, Yspahan or Troyes. Settlers is all about reacting in a fairly uninteresting manner to a completely random input. Your only choice deals with whom to trade, and perhaps, guesstimating considerably, where to place a house. I know of lots of games which do present me with interesting choices along the way.\n\nSettlers deserves humoungous credit for its relative simplicity, the introduction of resources and being able to trade them with others to the general public, and presence of dice—which are a quite familiar and necessary element to many non-gamers; and so opening the eyes of quite a lot of people to the availability of games other than Monopoly or Risk. But as a game I find it boring because there is very little to do and grating because I am expected to bash leaders in the most obvious of ways.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you and your group like to negotiate... then this title is fairly staple material.\n\nUpdate Auctioned off with the rest of the Settlers boardgame paraphernalia. It feels like a great burden has been lifted off my shoulders.\n\nUpdate 2 Very unexpectedly I was sitting behind a bunch of game material looking suspiciously like Catan's. It was... somewhat interesting, but also very boring. I got into a resource rut from which I could not pull out; trade just meant accelarating the competition's VP outlook more than mine. Even though I did score a non-neglegible amount of VPs I could not ever become a competitor for the win. The experience taught me that high relative frequencies of dice results mean nothing if you cannot link to a matching harbour to make the n : 1-trade more efficient; and that actually it's not really too bad to accept a lower relative frequency for resources which are more directly tied to VPs. You're safer from the Robber, and you're not limited by inefficient 4 : 1- or even 3 : 1-trades. But even so... the pauses of non-activity in this game plus the random clobbering by the Robber are really Not Fun; and I think that this is what after all this time sours me the most about Settlers. Its enduring popularity remains somewhat of a mystery.",

I introduce a lot of people to new games as I love reading rulebooks and teaching, personally, this wouldn't be a game I would introduce a new player to, as it can easily turn into a frustrating experience.\n\nBecause I've found that Catan is prone to players getting the board game version of 'soft locked', wherein you are entirely stuck for multiple turns without being able to take a single action.\n\nIn terms of it being a strategy game, the payoff for your planning and the actions you take don't feel as satisfying as in Agricola or in Gaia Project. This could be chalked up to the limited variety of actions you can take, which becomes rather repetitive, especially noticeable because the game runs long.\n\nPerhaps this game works best if everyone around the table is of the same skill level and have the same amount of comfort and familiarity with the game.",

I wouldn't say it completely determines the outcome of the game, but it takes a lot of work and luck for someone with a weaker start to overtake someone with a stronger start. That makes determining the optimal first move way too important.\n\nOnce the game starts, most turns, you won't have the resources to build, and game theory would dictate that trading would be disadvantageous for everyone, so the best move is to pass. And while I normally love games about blocking people's routes, getting boxed in or losing access to important tiles in Catan can ruin the game for you.\n\nBohnanza does trading better\nMachi Koro and Space Base are better for that \"roll dice and get stuff from things you've built\" mechanic\nAnd there are plenty of great games about building settlements or routes on a shared map, like Through the Desert.",

By the end of the second hour, we were throwing cards at the winning player for free in order to end the game faster. Unlike other games that are considered gateway - talking Ticket to Ride, Splendor, Carcassonne - this is the one that has most clearly shown its age, and grown moldy and stale in its design.

I wonder if it would achieve anything like the same success if it were released today. Would a publisher release it new, as-is, today? I doubt it.\n\nNot getting a single resource after rolling the dice on your turn (and/or every other player's turn) is just a crappy experience, especially for new gamers. People have such bad dice luck that they want to quit. And the game state changes so much, your plans are frequently dashed, making for long turns. The tightness and starting position in the four-player game can soon make victory hopeless: once you're blocked from expanding by aggressive players, it's game over. And the Robber and Knight are sadistic. How on earth is this a gateway game?\n\nUnless the kids are grown, this isn't a family game. And there are much better gateway games.

    "comment": "Although I have never owned Catan, I have played enough to feel as though I’ve gotten my moneys worth.\n\nI have a mixed relationship with Catan. On one hand, this game has introduced an entire new generation of players to actual board games (not just party or card games). It has usurped the monolithic Monopoly as the go-to board game. It has achieved great things and its contribution to the board game scene as a whole is unparalleled.\n\nI, however, dislike Catan. Catan sucks. It is not fun. It is like someone once ate hotdog buns (Monopoly), and upon discovering you could throw a hotdog (Catan) in there, your experience is increased tenfold and you feel as though you are enlightened. But you are missing all the ketchup, mustard, and relish that exist for games much better than Catan.\n\nMy main problem with Catan is that the board setup sucks. Oftentimes, there are 1-3 optimal spots which are gobbled up first, and the other players place for some middling positions. Catan mitigated this as best as possible with a snake draft, but it is unarguable that games are won and lost at placement. Sure, tiles are balanced as fairly as possible with a 2d6 distribution, but even then the resource swing is too great.\n\nCatan is an engine-building game. The player first to place a second settlement is often the winner, because they can bankroll their engine even faster. There is little counterplay (the most important element of a competitive game) for the sucker trying to hit 11s and 12s to build a road or settlement. In tandem, there is extremely limited flexibility: you have to plan out where you want to go long before you get there. With the minimal counterplay there is, it is usually racing to secure a spot via road/settlement before the next player. And what happens if the other player gets there first? All your resources and investments is a total sunken cost. Ports follow a similar vein - they are somewhat useful, but their fixed position can make them entirely useless or too expensive of a sink to even bother.\n\nThis game is relatively straightforward. Players can generally figure out the best course of action. Whether or not they are able to accomplish it is totally up to the whims of the dice gods. If you’re second to a resource or intersection, it is almost better if you had never tried in the first place. This leads to players often realizing their demise long before the game is over, similar to Monopoly and Risk’s greatest pitfalls.\n\nTo improve this game, there needs to be better counterplay and more flexibility. And unfortunately, by design, Catan offers very limited options. It’s an engine building lite game where you get slim resources by weighted chance; it’s a resource management game where you can lose half your resources on a 7 roll, or blow four turns of resources by someone beating you somewhere first.\n\nI don’t hate chance in games, I am not a skill-purist like some, but man when you lose to dice, and not to other players, it isn’t only unsatisfying, it is frustrating. I like games that are satisfying and rewarding, not games that are frustrating.",

The upgraded production is genuinely great: sturdier tiles, clean inserts, and some thoughtful touches that make setup and packdown feel way smoother. If you’re still playing Catan regularly, this is the version you want.\n\nThat said, my relationship with Catan has cooled over the years. It’s a classic, sure, but one that now shows its age. Especially when the dice and player dynamics leave you twiddling your thumbs. Still, it’s foundational to modern board gaming, and the 6th Edition feels like a fitting, polished tribute.\n\nFull review here if you want the long version: https://rolltoreview.com/catan-review-6th-edition-upgrade/",

I can't deny that I've loved and played it a lot. But Catan (especially with no expansions) just isn't interesting anymore. I have played it upwards of thirty times online against AIs, and as such I'm pretty much played out on the game. Diversify your hexes, go for largest army or longest road (whichever has less competition), and trade only as much as necessary. Spread out and diversify your resources early, then bulk up on cities mid-game. I don't know, strategies vary, but I just feel like I'm always playing Catan on rails. It feels solved.\n\nSo yes, Catan is a great gateway game. It's exciting for new players who've never played a German-style game before. But I don't need to buy the game, or its expansions -- there's no need to. I've got plenty of other games that scratch that itch, and while I'm happy to recommend it, there's no need for me to personally own it.\n\nSep '21: Rated 6\nDec '24: Rated 5",

We can all acknowledge and appreciate a good meritocracy, but as is the case in real life, only those who have get to play the game, while the have nots sit back and watch-- and the starting line that divides the two is determined by luck.\n\nIt does mean two things about this game. First, the most important decision (and only real hard one) you'll make is the very starting decision of your settlement, since that is what matters the most. From there on out, may the odds be ever in your favor.\n\nSecond, my favorite variant of Catan is ironically called the \"Welfare Variant\", where each time you do not get a resource off a roll, you receive a welfare token. You may then exchange welfare tokens for a resource of your choice at an exchange rate equal to your current number of points (so those in the lead require more tokens for a resource than those who have fallen behind).\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

It's pretty simple to teach and play. The game board setup is a bit awkward at first but once the pieces are in place it's fine.\n\nBut...it's a bit of an old beast now and while I detest the \"cult of the new\" approach to modern board\ngaming, it's undeniable that the game hasn't aged as well as it could have. It can be a bit too luck dependent with the dice rolls and can get annoying when you've picked settlement start points on statistically more likely numbers, only to have them barely come up for the whole game!\n\nIt can also last a bit long sometimes which isn't fun, especially if you are losing. I can be persuaded to play this on occasion but it's likely to find its way off of my board game shelf pretty soon as I am trying to adopt a one-in-one-out rule and Catan just doesn't see the light of day much anymore.\n\nNeil and Kristoffer own this.\n\n*Sold*",

There is a nice amount of strategy involved, but it's very hard to ignore the flaws.\nThere aren't enough ways to mitigate bad luck: if your numbers simply aren't rolled, you won't have as much cards to work with, and there's no alternative to that. Not even trading helps, since you need cards to trade away in the first place.\nSome resources are objectively better than others, which puts too much emphasis on the turn order and the starting positions (which makes it that much more difficult for new players to enjoy).\nThe robber makes the game too slow, especially since it is tied to the most likely number to be rolled. It just slows down everyone's building progress, and the blocking only makes the aforementioned bad luck sting that much more.\nThe game has a runaway leader problem; whoever builds a new settlement first is much more likely to pull ahead and win.",

Better at higher player counts, as the negotiation aspect is the best part about this game in my opinion. A lot of dice rolling to gain resources, which just isn't super fun or engaging for me.

We would have board game nights where we would specifically play this one game. Good memories.\n\nThis is the average entry level game to trick people into the hobby if the only other games they've played is monopoly or uno.\n\nRng is well done, player interaction is a lot of fun, but is prone to saltiness. I think that's the only reason why this game is a 6 and not a 7 to me. I've also had a lot of fond sessions with this one.\n\nEvery time I play this game, someone gets salty about the robber. Even though the robber is a mandatory action after rolling a 7, which happens more often than not.\n\nIf you roll your 7 first, guess you lose, because you just made yourself the bad guy. The one guy you target will hate you for the rest of the night, whether or not the robber affected their their tile or not.\n\nI've tried playing around this once by targeting a tile where it affected everyone. But that just meant that EVERYONE was salty against me the entire game, which meant no trading at all and being targeted by the robber from 3 other players then on. Not gonna lie I was salty this one game and it soured the entire game for me from then on.\n\nI outplayed myself and then got sick of the game.",

An excellent game that involves a touch of strategy, a forward-thinking perspective, and a lot of player interaction.\n\nI only use the Event Cards for this - I think it speeds the game up by quite a bit, as there is the possibility with a few of the cards to reward EVERYONE playing with a resource card - which is usually a good thing.\n\nThis is one of the few games out there that can be played \"AS IS\". What I mean by that is that there is no need for any house rules or other variants. It is a very well balanced and finely designed game that does not need tweaking or modifications to make it play \"better\". Not saying that is bad, but if you don't like to have to keep track of a bunch of house rules (Monopoly, Descent, etc.), then this game is perfect for you.\n\nThis game is also single-handedly responsible for the worst one-line cliche in all of gamedom - \"I have wood for your sheep.\" Although it is still funny to say, even if you aren't a Beavis and Butthead type fan.",

The game is essentially decided in the first three or four rounds (if not earlier by initial placement). That wouldn't be so bad, except games can last for an hour or more, which means the players who know they're going to loose have to keep going through the motions for a while which isn't exactly fun.\n\nUpdate: adding Seafarers and Cities and Knights has improved the game dramatically. There's still a runaway leader problem, but it's less pronounced as there are more ways to score (though unfortunately they still always come down to resource generation). I'll leave my original rating for the base game, but I'd put the game with those additions somewhere around a 7 or 7.5.",

Seeing that they shared a stone tile and I had the only other stone tiles I realized I could lock out their stone and create a stone monopoly forcing them to give me favorable trades.

    "comment": "CATAN’s box, with its ketchup and mustard color palette and lifeless illustrations, acts as a deterrent to people unfamiliar with modern board games. Somehow it has managed to sell millions of copies, so I guess it operates under the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” principle. I was initially smitten, but my enthusiasm quickly abated. Its vintage status partially excuses the fact that you need three or more people to play, but it doesn’t cut the mustard by today’s standards (just one more mustard reference and I’ll hit the trifecta). The ability to play these types of games with just one other person is what has really brought me and so many others into this hobby, and I have also begun to devour solo modes. But the bigger problem is game length. My last two four-player games of CATAN went on for two to three hours. That’s too long for something that really amounts to dice rolling and card trading. The “distance rule” seems to be the sticky wicket here, since it repeatedly foils opportunities for expansion and scoring. It’s annoying, and I think I prefer the game without it. Then there’s the trading mechanism, which is a chore. There’s no real point to it since people tend not to trade unless it is mutually beneficial, so there’s no actual creative wheeling and dealing. Is anyone willing to trade a brick? No? Okay. Your turn. Finally, there’s the robber, who stops being amusing pretty quickly. I try to keep my hand lean to avoid his wrath, but sometimes I get lucky on a couple of dice rolls between turns. I scheme up my best options as I wait for my turn, and once it comes I immediately roll a seven and lose half my bounty. Poof. No more options. Does anyone want to trade a brick? No? Okay. Your turn. I can still laugh about it, but they’re tears of a clown at this point. CATAN remains a great gateway game, especially for demonstrating how there can be a lot of fun inside the blandest of boxes. Monopoly is French’s yellow, CATAN is Grey Poupon, and now there’s an entire aisle full of stone ground, hand-crafted in small batches artisan mustards from which to choose. Trifecta.\n\nUpdate: Sold on February 4, 2025. For me, there are two major problems with CATAN: each game’s outcome is almost entirely luck-based, and my significant other refuses to play - and those are just the major problems. The luck aspect wouldn’t be so bad if this were a short, light experience; problem is, games always seem to move quickly until they inevitably stall out, and the lengthy deadlock that follows is all grind and no gratification. It’s also very ugly.",

I knew that there are endless spin-offs, expansions and versions so I thought this must have something going to it. The instructions are a bit overwhelming at first - it seemed to take almost an hour to set it up, read the overview and begin playing properly - but once that was out of the way we started really enjoying ourselves. As first-time players we weren't too hot on the strategy this time around, although by the end of the game all had become clear. The gameplay is light and fun, the setup intriguing, and the pacing pretty good too. Once we'd figured out the intricacies it became clear that this is a pretty simple game, but it contains enough fun elements we've played in other games (like the tracks in TICKET TO RIDE and resource-gathering in 7 WONDERS) to make for an enjoyable gameplay experience.",

I remember my first experience playing it for the first time as I began my board-gaming journey not too long ago, as it was the first game I had ever played at my college's board game club. When I arrived for my very first meeting, I was very nervous to say the least, but my nerves were quickly quashed by the friendly environment and a good game to play to break the ice, that game was Catan. The rules of the game were fairly easy to learn for a game of its size, most individuals that are interested should have no problem learning to play. Not to mention that its resource management and acquisition is seamless and simple, and varied every single time so that it may never grow stale, as the board shifts with each new play of the game. My favorite part of the game by far is going for \"The Longest Road\", trying to make the longest road possible, blocking my opponents from key resources, and gaining plenty of points along the way. While I have yet to win a game of Catan, as I often find myself playing against hard steeled veterans of the game, each time I find myself getting better and enjoying myself and the time I spend with my fellow club-mates, and with that Catan has become a game I would recommend, but only to those who I believe may enjoy it, as I don't think this game is for everyone, particularly those with shorter attention spans. With all that being said, I believe a firm 7.2 is deserved for Catan, although it may increase or decrease as my experience with the game continues.",

And if you cannot expand, it does not matter if later on you get the rolls you want, because you're trapped and you have NO chance of winning.\nHowever, it's a good game to start with boardgames.",

While the game is fantastic especially with the more recent editions it can be a bit 2 dimensional as most of the time you are waiting for a dice roll while avoiding holding 8 cards. Games can drag out for a lot longer. Personally I recommend the traders and barbarians expansion to spice things up as it still retains the original simplicity of Catan while solving the stagnation.",

I know that much has developed in tabletop gaming since Catan, but as a relative newcomer to the hobby, it definitely stood out to me for its historical significance and for its design. The randomness, though, with virtually no opportunity for mitigation, can be frustrating -- I'm looking at you, robber -- as can the kingmaking as the leading player approaches 10 VPs.

The quality of the new plastic pieces that represent the pieces from the players (compared to the old wood pieces) is diminished but not so bad that it is an active nuisances. The rest of the components are also out of cardboard. The design is simple and clear allowing focus on other aspects of the game. Component rating: 6/10\nThe setup is fast but a little tedious but allows for a lot of flexibility. Setup rating: 5/10\nThe games difficulty is very dependent on the skill level and trading finess of your opponents. The mechanics are intuitive and yet they can cause complex gameplay situations with player fighting for the “longest road” or complicated trade agreements. The rules are simple and easy to read allowing this game to be picked up by even the most casual board game enjoyer. Difficulty rating: 8/10\nAs every game is completely randomised there is a high degree of replayibility. Replayibility rating: 9/10\nAs the game is quite old at this point it its very easy to find a copy for a good price. 9/10\n\nI highly recommend this game as a must have in everyone’s collection its a fun game that can be played with even the most casual boardgame enjoyers. As well as having some great expansions to spice things up a little.\n\nNote: Difficulty rating games that are extremely complicated to the point where it’s difficult to understand what to do will get a lower rating.

    "comment": "One of the games that brought my sister and me beyond the borders of the known boardgame world. When we were kids, my mom used to play the Catan computer game, and when she found a copy of the board game at a local toy store, she bought it and taught it to us during our weekly summer holiday in the Austrian Alps. From then on, for about ten years, we would be playing Catan all week long while on holiday - but not during the year. This changed in the last few years, when I got more involved in board gaming, and we've played Catan during a weekend now and then.\n\nEven though this game could be considered old, I think it still holds up against its competitors nowadays. Catan has become a well-known game in the mass market, and I think that's a good thing.\n\nI like the game. Even if you're losing, you can still set your own small goals, achievements to be reached in your own personal struggle. I also like that the level of 'viciousness' is completely adaptable to the group's desires, while still staying within the framework of the rules: I once had a player who allowed another player to decide where he'd put the robber, as long as that other player promised to make a certain trade with him during that turn - on the other hand, I've also had games where the robber got parked out of harm's way because the player decided everyone had been punished enough by having to discard half of their cards.\n\nThere's an interesting variety of strategies available to players: will you invest in long road networks to grab and hold the longest trading route, or buy develoment cards in search of victory points (and the biggest army), work towards building up your infrastructure with many villages (preferable on tile numbers that already grant you resources) or upgrade your villages into large cities?\n\nThis may sound weird, but Catan leaves me room to develop a story. An epic tale about how the different civilizations on the island flourish or wither away. One remarkable thing about our copy, by the way, is that the red - statistically most likely to be rolled - numbers often get rolled less than the weird numbers with low odds, like 2's, 11's, or 12's.\n\nN.B.: I also prefer the wooden bits from my old copy over the ones from the wooden 15-year anniversary edition (though the wooden resource and number tiles are cooler) and especially over the plastic ones from newer editions.",

Mechanics tie well with the theme. Has strategic decisions. Trading allows \"playing the players\", not only the game. Some fun surprise moments, but not too often.\nDice luck plays a huge role, probably a bit too much, but often that sort of luck factor and thrill is what players seek. But when the dice are against you for several turns in a row, it could get annoying, and there is no mechanism to compensate.\n\nHas a bit of a runaway leader problem sometimes.

A higher rating means the game constantly feels different and new.\nSpeed: a lower rating means the game drags on, or not much happens when it’s not your turn. A higher rating means time flies when playing this game, or that things continue happening even when it’s not your turn. (The overall length of a game is not what is being rated, though this will contribute to the rating.)\nEase of learning: a lower rating means the rules are complex or cumbersome for most people. A higher rating means the rules can be grasped by most without a huge time input.\nTheme: a lower rating means the vibe isn’t the most compelling, or that the mechanics don’t thematically relate to the game’s world. A higher rating means the vibe is beautiful and fascinating, or that the mechanics thematically relate to the game’s world.\n\nEach category is weighted differently based on how much it matters to me for the overall rating.

The rules are simple, but provide a scaffold for risk-taking and negotiation. Catan was my introduction to \"euro\" games, but it's actually much more interactive than most games in that genre.\n\nOf course, luck plays a heavy role in this game, and player-to-player trade provides all of the usual feel-bad opportunities. But neither of these stop me from liking Catan. I don't feel a strong desire to play it these days, but that's because I played it to death as a teenager.

This makes every game of catan different and makes the game pretty replayable\n\nCons:\nThe game has a rich get richer kinda vibe to it as if you get a ton of resources early on you will be further ahead for almost the whole game\n\nThere are very few catch up mechanics which means that players who fall behind early will have minimal chance to win\n\nSide note:\nThe game feels completely different based on the player count in a 3 player game there is a lot of elbow room and more freedom on the board but a lot less trading opportunities which does make some strategies unviable\n\nwhereas the 4 player game has a lot less freedom to place roads and settlements but there is more trade Between the player making the game go faster and allowing some interesting plays and strategies to works\n\nRating:\nFun: 8.5/10\nWeight: 7.8/10\nStrategy: 8/10\ncomponents and art: 6.5/10\nSuggested player base: people new to board games or people who want a game with a good mix of luck and strategy but isn't too linear or extremely heavy",

It's easy to end up quickly in a 'cannot win' situation that some people despise being in.\n\nHowever, I don't play games to win, I play to interact with friends and have fun. Sure, I LIKE winning, and its happens sometimes, but I'm not actually very good at games.\nAnd I LOVE Catan. As with many, it was one of my gateway games, and it's one I made my own craft supply version of back when £50 for a game seemed like a ridiculous cost (oh the innocence of those days!).\n\nI'll always be happy to crack out this classic, a game that paved the way for so many other games, and brought millions of gamers into the fold.\nIt deserves love, even if it's not your cup of tea.",

The player interaction between trading resources, jockeying for position, and racing for 10 victory points is incredibly addicting. It feels good to collect your resources and see how your settlements, cities, and roads leads to more abundance. The down sides are that the dice and robber can sometimes become quite frustrating and if your starting position isn’t optimal, you might have a bad time.

    "comment": "A interação entre os jogadores é certamente o aspecto mais marcante e divertido de Catan, característica esta que pode também fazer as partidas demorarem um pouco além do que diz na caixa caso os jogadores sejam muito insistentes e/ou lentos na hora de negociar. A forte dependência de sorte na produção de matéria-prima também pode fazer as partidas ficarem arrastadas dependendo da situação dos jogadores no tabuleiro (ex. se um determinado recurso estiver frequentemente faltando à todos na mesa e ao mesmo tempo ninguém tiver porto). Caso a partida seja com tabuleiro aleatório, é importante auxiliar bastante os novatos na Fase de Fundação, pois se posicionarem mal suas aldeias iniciais, terão uma péssima experiência do jogo.\n\nO manual diz que quando os jogadores estiverem experientes pode-se ignorar a regra de só poder construir após a fase de negociação. Eu achei melhor sem esta regra mesmo, pois ela deixa o jogo mais travado, porém a retirada dela também pode aumentar o downtime, já que os jogadores poderão fazer mais ações em seus turnos.\n\nO tempo de partida com quatro jogadores gira entre 40 minutos (partida considerada bem rápida) e 1h40min (tempo máximo).\n\nMuita gente critica o Catan ferrenhamente, comparando-o com inúmeros outros jogos atuais, mas na maioria das vezes a comparação é péssima porque não consideram um simples e notório elemento que o diferencia dos outros: a possibilidade de negociação. A real é que, ainda hoje, poucos jogos possuem esse mecanismo, pois é um elemento extremamente difícil de fazer bem feito e Catan o implementa com maestria. Um detalhe que acho importante frisar é que em Catan não se pode dar um recurso a outro jogador sem receber algum outro recurso em troca. Me parece algo importante de ressaltar porque já vi até produtor de conteúdo dizendo que se pode fazer isso e dizendo inclusive que sempre jogou assim e que é isso que faz o jogo ser divertido. Catan é um jogo que tem alguns detalhes de regra cruciais para manter a competitividade, e não duvido nada que muitas dessas avaliações negativas venham de experiências ruins de partidas jogadas com regra errada como esta.\n\nUm erro grave que ouço pessoas comentarem que fazem, por exemplo, é sortear as fichas numeradas no tabuleiro. Não faça isso! Pois o espaçamento entre os números é importante e garantido pela colocação correta das fichas. Esse equívoco além de não estar nas regras, ainda desbalanceia o jogo. Catan possui um setup bastante espeficio (mesmo aleatorizando os tiles) e aleatorizar as fichas numeradas não faz parte dele.\n\nUma dica para melhorar a fluidez do jogo (embora possa diminuir a transparência) é, no momento da produção, todos pegarem seus recursos ao mesmo tempo.\n\nUma sugestão para melhorar a transparência em mesas muito competitivas é convencionar entre os jogadores que no momento de construir, ao invés de descartar os recursos de volta no monte, eles devem ser descartados em uma área separada de descarte.\n\nAinda sobre transparência, uma dica em relação à carta de progresso Monopólio (que pode facilmente ser alvo de trapaça por obrigar todos os jogadores a lhe entregar todas as cartas da matéria-prima do tipo que você escolher) é: caso você desconfie que alguém está roubando, basta fazer a contagem das cartas no monte. É um procedimento simples e que pode ser aproveitado inclusive para conferência das cartas em jogo. Mas não faça esse procedimento sem motivos. Faça somente em sua vez, quando jogar a carta (Monopólio), e se desconfiar que alguém está omitindo cartas que deveria lhe entregar.\n\nNo final das contas a diversão proporcionada suplanta todas as críticas que fiz, e acaba sempre sendo uma experiência muito prazerosa, principalmente quando todos na mesa aprenderam bem o jogo. Sempre saio TENSO das partidas de Catan, principalmente quando ganho. Porque a qualquer momento alguém pode \"bater\" na sua frente. \\o/\n\n• Rejogabilidade/Minimização de Scripts: 10\n• Qualidade do Desafio/Catch Up: 10\n• Qualidade Interação Jogadores: 10\n• Qualidade da Suspensão da Vitória: 10\n• Minimização de AP/Downtime: 9\n• Mitigação da Sorte: 7\n• Fidelidade Tempo Caixa: 8\n• Minimização Dependência de Honestidade: 8\n• Elegância de Regras/Intuitividade: 9\n• Estética: 10\n• Coerência Temática: 8\n• Produção e Imersão: 9\n• Praticidade Preparação/Manutenção: 7\n• Armazenamento (com sleeve): 10\n• Manual: 9\nNota Resultante: 8,9\n\n(detalhamento dos quesitos no tópico da Ludopedia: https://ludopedia.com.br/topico/83397)",

I won games even with bad numbers, cause I had to rethink my strategy and chose one, which fits the best to my numbers. I also lost games where I thought I cant lose. In the end it's based on a dice, why you can't predict the success of your chosen strategy. Thanks to the non static board and numbers, you can adapt your board and numbers individually. You can reveal the numbers before settling, or reveal it after. Build your own board or even reveal the tiles after settling: It's up to you! It's also possible to push newbies or get an disadvantage, if youre an expert player > Non static Board and numbers makes it possible.\n\nDue to the robber and the trading between players, it's a very social game and as a reason very unpredictable (Other than some low rated comments explain)\n\nWith the help of the expansions you can adapt the complexity and duration to your preferences. Some expansions also reducing the influence of dice and luck.\n\nIt's one of the games I grew up with and I am convinced, that even my kids will like it in the future.",

On the surface there's loads of luck involved in gathering resources, but this is part of risk management in this game. Without randomness and unequal distribution of resources players would have no incentive to negotiate and trade. That player interaction and convesations around the table are the very things that make playing Catan an enjoyable experience. You just need to play with an easy-going group of friends who are willing to actively participate in negotiations. I had fun playing this game and would gladly revisit it some time in the future.\n\n/update, May 2024: I have revisited after 8 years and I think Catan still holds up and has the type of player interaction very few other euros have. There are better trading games, better resource management games and better games with map expansion out there, but I still haven't found anything else that would combine those three elements in such a way.\n\nI can't wait to try some of the expansions (especially the event deck, the Harbormaster and the Fishermen module from T&B).\n\n/update: Traders & Barbarians is wonderful, get this expansion! You know what? I've grown to LOVE this game. especially with some easy to implement expansion content. There is really something special about it that no other game really does in the same way. And I never feel downtime in Catan, there's always something to count on or analyse during other players' turns. This is an absolute classic and it's a real shame it doesn't have the appeal among \"serious gamers\".\n\n/update: I have to try Seafarers with the abovementioned modules from T&B, I think this would be a very fun way of experiencing Catan! I really liked what ships bring to the game, but I still think the event deck is my favourite module. I'm extremely pleased with all this additional content and I'm honestly keen on playing Catan regularly!

The rules are easy to teach and playing the game works on an intuitive level. It's versatile in terms of adjusting risk and goals. The flow of the game can produce a relaxed, layed back atmosphere, but also serious and tense situations.\n\nIt's one of those low commitment and high impact games with a lot of freedom in how you play. Most common points of criticism seem to be randomness, dependancy on starting locations and runaways as a consequence, but I find the game to feel rewarding because of them.\n\nAll in all, Catan has everything I enjoy about classic Euro-games. It has a nice mixture of strategy, luck, and negotiation, it oscillates between cooperation and competition, it plays quickly and easily, it's flavorful, it's professionally produced, and, as a bonus, expansions can be used to customize in both directions of complexity.",

    "comment": "Catan, criado por Klaus Teuber e lançado em 1995, é um dos jogos de tabuleiro modernos mais conhecidos no mundo. Ele foi responsável por popularizar o gênero “eurogame” fora da Europa e mudou o mercado de board games, mostrando que jogos de estratégia podiam ser acessíveis, interativos e interessantes para todo tipo de público.\n\nNo jogo, cada participante é um colono tentando desenvolver assentamentos na ilha fictícia de Catan. O tabuleiro é formado por peças hexagonais de terrenos (como pasto, floresta, campo, montanha e colina), distribuídas aleatoriamente a cada partida, o que garante variedade e rejogabilidade.\n\nO objetivo é ser o primeiro a alcançar 10 pontos de vitória, que podem ser conquistados de várias maneiras: construindo assentamentos e cidades, fazendo a estrada mais longa, tendo o maior exército (através de cartas de cavaleiro) e obtendo cartas de desenvolvimento.\n\nA dinâmica central gira em torno da coleta de recursos. Cada terreno gera um recurso diferente (madeira, tijolo, trigo, ovelha ou minério) quando seu número correspondente é sorteado no dado. Os jogadores usam esses recursos para construir estradas, assentamentos e cidades. Mas como nem sempre você terá os recursos certos, a troca é fundamental: os jogadores podem negociar entre si, oferecendo trocas diretas ou tentando acordos vantajosos.\n\nAs negociações são a alma do jogo. Frequentemente, um jogador precisa convencer os outros a trocar, gerando conversas, blefes e pequenas alianças temporárias. Ao mesmo tempo, existe uma dose de sorte, pois a produção depende dos dados e da posição inicial dos assentamentos, o que pode fazer um jogador ficar um tempo sem receber recursos.\n\nO ladrão, uma peça especial, traz mais interação e tensão. Ele é movido toda vez que sai um 7 nos dados, bloqueando um terreno e impedindo a produção de recursos nele. O jogador que move o ladrão ainda pode roubar uma carta de recurso de alguém adjacente, criando rivalidades e estratégias para proteger suas áreas mais produtivas.\n\nVisualmente, Catan é marcante com peças de madeira, cartas coloridas e um tabuleiro que muda a cada partida. As regras são simples de aprender, mas a profundidade vem das negociações, do timing para construir, da ocupação de espaços-chave e das decisões sobre quais recursos priorizar.\n\nCatan funciona melhor com 4 jogadores, mas também é possível jogar com 3. Existem expansões para mais pessoas e para adicionar elementos como comércio marítimo, guerras e até missões cooperativas. O tempo de partida gira em torno de 60 a 90 minutos.\n\nNo geral, Catan é um jogo de estratégia, negociação e sorte equilibrados. Ele pede planejamento, flexibilidade e comunicação, sem ser complicado demais. Por isso, se tornou um clássico para apresentar novos jogadores ao mundo dos board games. Se você procura um jogo com interação, decisões importantes e partidas sempre diferentes, Catan é uma escolha segura e versátil.",
