When I read about this game, it sounded clever and interesting. After two plays, I found it dull and boring because the scoring feels largely out of our control.",

The game board has beautiful graphics and lots of charm. Great for adults for an opening game or filler game. SdJ children's game award winner 1992. The board is actually much more charming than the card game edition of this game.\n\nSuitable for 2 players. 30 mins absolute max. Very light game. Trade as we have another version of this game.",
