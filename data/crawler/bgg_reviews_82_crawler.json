    "comment": "3rd edition: Didn't like the battle-board mechanic as implemented: melee, outflanking, artillery, column routs in any column, all felt a bit off to me. Leader system also seemed a bit superficial, especially the leader change rolls. New map artwork is a step down from previous editions. The new blocks look great, though.",

Nearly all of the Columbia block games I have played are better and more fun for me than this one.\n\nThere are interesting ideas, like the leader activation, but overall I find the game a bit fiddly, with crowded fronts and little space for maneuver. The Union numerical superiority invites you to carry out an unimaginative attritional strategy that the Confederacy will find difficult to stop.\n\nIn general I also prefer point-to-point maps -the most common in Columbia Games- rather than hexagons.",

    "comment": "My rating applies only to the 3rd edition as I have no experience with the former ones. Not that accurate a simulation, as others have noted, the Rebs just can't do what they actually did without houseruling and will have to resort more to turtling. But given the level of abstraction the big picture of the theater somewhat comes through. As a game it's awesome, both sides will face painstakingly difficult choices every play. The tactical battle resolution familiar from Napoleon, trimmed to near perfection here, is a great addition to the \"EastFront Lite\" command control system. The battle system adds another layer of agonizing decisions and most importantly is FUN. Even the longest scenario usually doesn't play longer than 6 months of EastFront, so in that regard Bobby Lee is a definite go to game for me. The minor gripes I had about balance in the beginning aren't an issue after a few more plays, and were just due to my lack of experience. Close matches every time save a couple quick defeats because of drastic mistakes made.",
