Having more villains appear through the deck is something, at least, so even if you get that first one you have a real reason to accuse someone else. But it's an awful game in nearly every sense.\n\nUnfortunately, this is one of our regulars and I just bite down and bear through. It is only some kind of filler, after all...",
