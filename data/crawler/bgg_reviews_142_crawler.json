But is is a very dry, no pun intended, experience.\n\nThe game drags towards the end and whenever I played it so far I wanted it to end about 30 minutes sooner.\n\nI got it for 4â‚¬ at a thriftshop. I would not want to pay much more for it though.",

I was quite bad at getting awards of free vineyards from the government.\n\nI doubt that I ever play much more of this game. It is good, but not new, nor especially seductive. I am glad to have played it.",

The theme is great, but I believed too many of the other comments here.\nThe mechanic is well balanced, and decisions are almost always meaningful.\n\nDON'T LISTEN TO THEM! This game is a great resource management game. Decisions are never trivial, and frequently excrutiating. The combination of competition and cooperation is also a refreshing nuance. This game is a great one.\n\nUpdate: This game only works with 4+ players. With 2 or 3 the board is too open and the game becomes intensely uninteresting.",

    "comment": "Commodities game that's quite deep. It's a bit of a brain-burner at first as you try to figure out the value of controlling the market: what type of vineyards to buy, where to buy, how much to spend, when to sell, how much to sell, etc. Some of the economic decisions influence selling prices & turn-order. There's also a bit of a strange area control mechanism wherein many regions have government controlled vineyards and once all of the privately owned vineyards have been bought in that region the rest are given away properties: 1 to the player in first place in that region, 2 to the player in second place & the rest to the player in 3rd place (anybody else is shut out). I should mention that although it's an extremely economic game the winner is the player who owns the most vineyards rather than the player with the most money. Fun theme with excellent bits (wine bottles, grapes, a barrel, colourful pieces).",

    "comment": "Wow, this game is tricky, vicious, and cool, and it is really standing the test of time - or so I say November 2006. Advice: Use the little punch-out circles from the grape-holding wine cellar cards as six feet for those cards. With the added height, the grapes are held off the table, and much more stably. I've even considered permanently affixing them to the cards, if I could just bring myself to defile the sanctity of a game well made.",
