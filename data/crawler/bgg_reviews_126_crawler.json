    "comment": "There's a lot of randomness in the game. Every move is dependent on a RANDOM die roll, some of the cards are much more powerful than others. You can avoid being on a fence but you cannot do anything if someone decides to trip your horse on a plain field. I suppose if everyone got the same set of cards, this could have been mitigated better, but no - you get three RANDOM cards. Lane position is also RANDOM every game. You might start every race from lane 1 while someone else could get stuck with lanes 5 and 6. Despite of that, the game could provide quite a few laughs if in the right group and everyone is in the right mood. Unfortunately, it's too long for what it is to attract multiple plays.\n\n---\nlebryant's TOP games of all time\n---\n[2022]: 208/294 (top 71%) | Rating - 4 | Overall Plays - 1\n[2021]: 219/288 (top 76%) | Rating - 4 | Overall Plays - 1\n[2019]: 194/256 (top 76%) | Rating - 4 | Overall Plays - 1",
