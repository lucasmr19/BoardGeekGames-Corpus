The original combat system is a ridiculous gambit of which player can amass more catapults more quickly and plow through the entire fractured empire unopposed.....stupid. A more Shogun-like combat system makes the game really enjoyable, and is a truly unique, enjoyable, innovative game experience. The Italia player must always go FIRST, never LAST (or they never have a chance in heck).",

Catapults ridiculously overpowered and limited to 20 shared between all players, so often strategy came down to picking fights just to generate casualties that you could rebuy on your own turn.\nComponents were of a brittle plastic that ended to snap off.\nRerelease edition by Eagle Games is much better",

This game is just plain 'fun' and that's all there is to it.\n\nIt is simple and less cumbersome than all of the other games that I have played. Sure, these other games are more 'historical' but I'm finding that the path to victory is usually the same in ALL of these games.\n\nBy that I mean, what happens is usually two parties make a gigantic army, have one big battle where one side is annihilated and then 'that's that'. The game is virtually over.\n\nIs that historical? Yes, often it is. The Ancient world was often like that. One big battle decided it all. \"Charonea\", \"Guagamela\", \"Actium\", \"Pharsalus\" and so on.\n\nSo, I can spend hours setting up a large scenario from \"Imperium Romanum\" and taking at least that long to play it and the 'decisive' point of the game is always the same. One big battle where one side is destroyed.\n\nI find, that I can achieve almost the same results playing this game in a multi-player environment where everyone has fun.",
