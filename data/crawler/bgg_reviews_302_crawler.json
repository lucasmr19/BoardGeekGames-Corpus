    "comment": "Original.\nReally like the board/mat nice production and as for the coins well what can you say? Senator pieces are a bit weak! It's a strange game but certainly a thought provoker. First game I messed up the least penalty not realising that 0 would be considered the least, therefore a lot of people got away without having to have a presence in a line or room and not getting penalised for it. All in all a good little game which is fun to play and relatively quick too!\n\nOwned: 17 years\nPlayed: 23\nLast play: 31/12/2023",
