Killing the wargame industry completely.\nThis game should have been a warning of things to come.",

It's also more depth then just pounding each other back and forth, but some times wind, weather gauge and port cards (and calamities) go against you and your fleet either can't or gets stuck in port. Great fun though, though cutting the line rules are a little tricky.",
