I've had success bringing various other games to the group, but this one - not. They all hated it, and whether we were just playing it badly or something I don't know, but it didn't really ever seem to get going.\n\nNow, every time I bring a new game around to them, they always check \"It's not got spies, has it?!\" - so it's become a group in-joke as a Rubbish Game. Which I guess means it doesn't deserve a high rating ;-)",
