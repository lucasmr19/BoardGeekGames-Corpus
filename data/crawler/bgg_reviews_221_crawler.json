There is an experience point RPG system for their generals, random turn order and a bidding maket for dangerous Ninjas included, that can be ordered to kill experienced enemy generals.\n\nAll in all a more detailed, engaging setting and game, that s dripping full of theme due to the artwork of all gamng piece including its miniatures.\n\nAn all time classic - that competes with modern titles mostly through its nostalga factor.",

And a price that's more than $50 more than what most people would pay. Perhaps some games are just better off left in the past?\n\n------------------------\n\nA stylish, elegant alternative to Risk set in Japan, this game was a staple of my board gaming youth. It's not terribly complex, but there are a couple of interesting strategic options (although make no mistake, having more troops than your opponent is always a good idea).\n\nThe only drawback is it takes forever to play; we would usually leave it set up for weeks at a time and play it over several 2-hour sessions.",

It was originally released in 1986 as Shogun by Milton Bradley but though it is an old game it is very fun and challenging to play.",
