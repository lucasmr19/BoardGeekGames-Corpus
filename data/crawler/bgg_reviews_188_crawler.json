The manual might as well have been written in the hieroglyphics used around the time of the game’s creation. “Easy to Learn” they say to most other games that such statement truly applies to, yet this game is not in the slightest. Other than being basically incomprehensible, it barely is a game in itself. While there is some decisions where to put the stones, that’s all the game is, pick up a stone and place it down where you see fit on the board. This game has failed to survive the test of time, only leeching a player base off those whom have mistaken it for some other game, or just have no other game to play.",

    "comment": "Disclaimer: This is a standalone game. Its rating is based on desire to play.\n\nGo is a great game, indubitably. It has survived millennia of gaming evolution and remains popular today as artifical intelligence has finally overcome the best human players. I took great pleasure in watching the battles between humans and AlphaGo, especially with the insightful commentary of Michael Redmond, and the added knowledge of a good friend of mine, who's one of France's very best Go players.\n\nWhen it comes to design, there's only one thing I would criticize in Go and that is the concept of komi. I find it extremely inelegant, even downright ridiculous when two countries have different ones, and would prefer games to be played in sets of two with players switching colors halfway through. The winner would then be determined by the sum of his two scores.\n\nOverall I would give the design of Go a 8/10 rating, as I find it to be the ultimate strategy game (while Chess would be a great - if not the ultimate - tactics game). Yet I have absolutely no desire to play the game and must rate it a 3/10 according to my criteria.\n\nNot only is Go part of the family of abstract games, which I generally dislike, I also find its huge grid to be very intimidating and very hard to read. The concept of the game is crystal-clear, yet when the board starts to fill and players attack each other, it is very hard for me to read who controls which territory. For this reason I have to rate it even lower than Chess, because at least if I play Chess with somebody as skilled as me I will understand what's happening, whereas a game of Go against my evil twin would result in a series of random moves with a random winner in the end (probably white, because of komi).",

Anyone with enough experience will agree in the depth this game really has. Maybe a 5/5 weight, to be honest.\n\nWhat I really dislike about this game is that is the most tiring game I ever played, even when I do tsumegos and I know a few tricks, playing vs AI or real oponents is always a huge challenge and I almost always lose, even tho I can play Mage Knight or Spirit Island without any problem. This game requires more than just knowing the rules, and when I play several games in a week I feel mentally exhausted (which is not good for my job).

There is no strategy in Go: any wrong move puts you in checkmate until your opponent makes his own mistake, so it's more of a very nebulous puzzle. On the other hand, as soon as he does, then the pressure is back on him.\n\nThe very good part is the part where a single mistake has huge consequences, resulting in strong and forth. The very bad part is that understanding what is a mistake and why it is a mistake is hopelessly opaque, you have to reverse engineer the entire game from the end (or at best an entire tsumego of dozens of moves). Learning this just isn't rewarding, but the game is good if you overcome that mountain.\n\nReplaces Hex for me, same type of gameplay and same type of punishmnent for mistakes.\n\n2022: Yeah, it's glorified nim but nebulous enough to require years of studies. It's a game of memory and pattern recognition, not a strategy game. The best version of nim i guess. Unlike chess where you need to backtrack to find out when you could have avoided starting. a chain of moves, in go studying the past moves is pointless, you have to study ALL future moves from a specific play if you want to learn anything from it, which is just painful.\n\n2023: having mistakes be so unclear makes it a respectable but ultimately unpleasant game. Still rating it a 6, but when i do play/study it out of my desire to become a well rounded player and being stumped by it, i must say i am not having a good time. Go is a good game for reasons that i hate.",

I have nothing but the utmost respect for it - the few full games I've had the pleasure of playing have challenged me in ways I hadn't thought possible from a board game.\n\nBut herein lies my complaint. Go is so huge and so complex that it requires an enormous time commitment. I'm talking 6-8 hours for one 19x19 game, at least for an amateur. As the board becomes more populated, and piece placement carries greater consequence, you find yourself taking more and more time before placing a piece. I just don't have that kind of time to devote to a game regularly.\n\nSo, as much as I love Go, I can only enjoy it every once in a while.

I recently started doing some puzzles on mobile apps and have already fallen out of the habit, but I'd like to return and take cracks at it until it becomes a more stable ongoing practice (both puzzles and games, at least asynchronous or live speed matches on smaller boards). When liberties and shapes finally start to click a bit I do find that it deepens ones ability to read board states and understand/appreciate other games. As much as I admire it though, I don't think I will ever be able to have as much fun with it as I do \"shallower\" spatial abstract games, and I'm ok with that (being a pleb).\n\nUpdate: I've recommitted to studying this game and am enjoying it more and more. It really does take a while for things to set in well enough to feel like you are engaging with the game (and I just barely am at this point still).",

Go/Baduk/Weiqi is one of these games, and Go has become my lifestyle game. It feels less like a game and more like a language, as you come to understand it more and more. I'm almost a year in and around 1 kyu in rank, and within that year of intense study, consumption and memorization of numerous pro games, lessons I feel like I see a totally different game than when I first started. That said, I have much much much more to see, so much more to experience, and undeniably a lifetime to learn. Within this time Go has changed much of my personal life as I've made friends through it I otherwise wouldn't have, and I am studying Mandarin solely for the game. I have trips planned for the purpose of studying the game with teachers abroad. Of course it's affected my bank account as I've purchased a nice Goban, nice table boards, stones of different make and sizes. The game has an aesthetic few can hold a candle to. However, even if I had the simplest of stones and the cheapest of boards, this game would captivate me to no end.

Skylar suspects it's because I'm too bad at the game to understand that it's actually more opaque than I think it is. I don't know. I've played dozens of times. If she's played a handful of times or fewer, I can see how it can still feel opaque. My brain naturally orients better around spatial games regardless. I can see it getting tricky in complicated positions where both players are surrounding each other like Russian dolls and it's not clear who's actually in trouble, but most normal positions are quite interpretable. I was obsessed with this game for like a year or two, read a bunch of books, had a regular opponent to grind out games against (and I tended to win). I'm not \"good\" by any stretch, but I'm pretty sure I would destroy anyone who's played 10 times or fewer. I have other games in the collection that I consider much more opaque than Go. For example, The Gallerist (or any Lacerda), Wabash Cannonball (or any cube rails game), Pax Renaissance, Le Plateau, and John Company. Imperial, Indonesia, Cavum, and Tokyo Tsukiji Market would probably be up there too, if I ever manage to get them played.",

In terms of perfection, Go would be 99/100, while Chess is 9/10\n\nThe only reason why this isn't a 10, is because it takes way too long to master; if you think Chess takes effort and patience to be good at it..Go is simply on another level; I'd say Go is roughly about x3 more difficult to learn/to be good at than Chess and it also takes about x5 longer to master.\n\nOne interesting thing about Go is that you can really \"feel\" the personality of a player you are playing Go against in an EXTREME detail; if you do this in Chess it's like you can see and tell your opponent's personality through the lens of blood type system (which has just four options -blood type O, A, B, and AB-; in another words, the unique kind of player that can be grasped/identified while playing Chess from your opponent is far more limited, feels less unique, and in comparison far less pronounced than in Go), whereas when playing Go, players can tell your opponent's personality through lens of MBTI types (16 different unique personalities). Btw, I think both personalities tests (blood type and MBTI) are both silly and meaningless and I believe 99.99% it's meant for fun; I'm just using them as an analogy to show how Go allows you to reveal exactly what type of a player your opponent is (it's usually revealed in a negative way, as in a \"how flawed your opponent is in a specific way [too careful, too carelessly aggressive, unreliably inaccurate with his/her plays, etc,] unless your opponent is a very strong player who's near flawless;\" of course, you also have to be an extremely deep thinking person with a very sharp observational mind that allows to grasp the details of the specific personality of your opponent that can be demonstrated through a game of Go) which is FAR more varied and multi-layered than Chess can ever be.",
